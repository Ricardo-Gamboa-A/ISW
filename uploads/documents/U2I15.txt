s-triazine-degrading  bacterial  strains  were  isolated 
from  long-term  simazine-treated  agricultural  soils  of 
central  chile.  the  number  of  culturable  heterotrophic 
bacteria of these agricultural soils (7 x 106 cfu/g of dry 
soil)  was  not  affected  by  simazine  application  on  field. 
the simazine-degrading bacterial strains p51, p52 and 
c53  were  isolated  by  enrichment  in  minimal  medium 
using simazine as the sole nitrogen source. resting cells 
of  strains  p51  and  p52  degraded  >80%  of  simazine 
within  48  hrs,  whereas  strain  c53  was  able  to  remove 
>60% of the herbicide. the atza and atzd genes of the s-
triazine  upper  and  lower  catabolic  pathways  were 
detected  in  strains  p51  and  c53,  while  only  atzd  gene 
was  observed  in  strain  p52.  to  compare  the  bacterial 
16s  rrna  gene  sequence  structure,  ardra  were 
performed  using  the  restriction  enzymes  msp1  and 
hha1. ardra indicated that strain p52 was a different 
ribotype  than  c53  and  p51  strains.  for  further 
characterization  the  novel  isolates  were  identified  by 
16s rrna gene sequencing. strains c53 and p51 belong 
to  the  genus  stenotrophomonas  and  the  strain  p52 
belongs to the genus arthrobacter. s -triazine-degrading 
bacterial strains isolated from contaminated soils could 
be  used  as  biocatalysts  for  bioremediation  of  these 
herbicides. 

soil  decontamination  is  one  of  the  main  environmental 
challenges for the third millennium to safeguard the planet.

worldwide  and  their  application  has  increased  in  the  last 
decades. the united states is the main herbicide consumer, 
with an annual application of around 205,000 tons (kiely et 
al.  2004).  the  european  union  registered  an  annual 
consumption of around 130,000 tons of herbicides between 
1990 and 2000 (fao, 2006), wherein france (26%), united 
kingdom (17%) and italy (12%) head the herbicide usage. 
in south america, the annual use of herbicides was around 
60,000  tons  between  1990  and  2000  (figure  1).  brazil 
(38%), argentina (28%) and colombia (18%) are the main 
herbicide consumers in south america.

triazine ring.  

s-triazine compounds have been used for weed control in 
many  countries  for  more  than  40  years  (wackett  et  al. 
2002;  dinamarca  et  al.  2007).  these  synthetic  and 
chlorinated herbicides (figure 2) inhibit the photosynthetic 
electron transfer in target plants (rousseaux et al. 2001). s-
triazines  have  been  applied  as  pre-  and  post-emergence 
herbicides  for  broadleaf  and  grassy  weed  control  in  corn, 
citrus, alfalfa, grapes, avocado and olives crops (wackett et 
al. 2002; cooman et al. 2005). their non-agricultural uses 
include  weed  control  on  right-of-ways,  ornamental  trees 
and golf fairways. in 2001, the european union reported a 
list  of  priority  hazardous  substances  (european  union, 
2001). atrazine and simazine have been included in this list 
due 
leaching 
capacity and potential to adsorb onto soils and sediments. 
commonly,  s-triazine  herbicides  detected  in  water  exceed 
the  maximum  contaminant  levels  allowed  for  drinking 
water  in  european  union  (0.1  g/l)  and  usa  (3.0  g/l) 
(rousseaux  et  al.  2001).  although  s-triazines  have  been 
prohibited in many european countries, in chile there are 
no restrictions  for  their use and  atrazine  and  simazine  are 
the  most  frequently  applied  herbicides  in  agriculture  and 
forestry. s-triazine  consumption  in  chile  was  around  350 
tons during 2004 (dinamarca et al.2007), which represents 
10%  of  the  herbicide  usage.  s-triazine  herbicides  have 
been  recently  detected  as  contaminants  in  agricultural 
watersheds in south-central chile (cooman et al. 2005).

degradation  by  microorganisms  is  the  primary  removal 
mechanism  of 
soil 
(newcombe  and  crowley,  1999;  dinamarca  et  al.  2007; 
hernandez et al. 2008a). for environmental bioremediation, 
the  isolation  of  microorganisms  capable  of  degrading  the 
target  pollutant  is  important.  a  number  of  s-triazine-
degrading bacteria have been described (mandelbaum et al. 
1995;  devers  et  al.  2007;  hernandez  et  al.  2008b).  the 
bacterial enzymes for s-triazine degradation are encoded by 
atza, atzb, atzc, atzd, atze and atzf genes (figure 3) (de 
souza  et  al.  1998;  martinez  et  al.  2001;  iwasaki  et  al. 
2007). 
the aim of this study was to isolate novel bacterial strains 
capable to degrade s-triazines from agricultural soils in the 
quillota valley, central chile. for enrichment and isolation 
of  bacterial  strains,  long-term  simazine  treated  soils  were 
used.  physiological,  biochemical  and  molecular  studies 
were  carried  out  to  characterize  and  identify  bacterial 
isolates, which could be used as novel biocatalysts for soil 
bioremediation.

novel s-triazine-degrading bacteria isolated from chilean agricultural soils 

the  morphology  of  bacterial  colonies  on  tsa  plates  was 
observed. the bacterial growth in luria bertani (lb) broth 
(tryptone  10  g/l,  yeast  extract  5  g/l,  nacl  5  g/l) 
supplemented with simazine (2.5 mm) was determined by 
measuring  turbidity  at  600  nm.  for  electron  microscopy, 
bacterial  cells  grown  in  am  medium  with  simazine  were 
treated  and  observed  with  a  zeiss  em900  electron 
microscope as described previously (camara et al. 2004).  
analysis of simazine degradation 
cells  grown  in  lb  broth  supplemented  with  simazine  at 
30oc  until  exponential  phase,  were  washed  and 
resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) to 
a  turbidity600nm  of  ~5.  resting  cells  were  incubated  with 
simazine ( 0.5 mm ) for 48 hrs.  

liquid 

chromatography 

simazine was extracted with isooctane and quantified using 
high-performance 
(hplc) 
(martinez  et  al.  2007;  hernandez  et  al.  2008b).  samples 
were  analyzed  using  a  beckman  liquid  chromatograph 
equipped  with  a  diode  array  detector  and  a  rp-
c18/lichrospher 5-m column (supelco, bellefonte, usa). 
the chromatograph was operated at room temperature and 
uv detection at 230 nm. the samples were eluted at a flow 
rate  of  0.5  ml/min  using  a  mobile  phase  containing  67% 
(v/v)  acetonitrile,  32.5%  (v/v)  water  and  0.5%  (v/v) 
phosphoric  acid  (ph  2.0).  the  flow  rate  was  1  ml/min. 
simazine was identified and quantified by comparison with 
an authentic standard. 
analysis of catabolic atz genes  
the  atza  and  atzd  genes  were  amplified  by  polymerase 
chain  reaction  (pcr)  using  specific  primers  as  described 
(de souza et al. 1998; devers et al. 2004). genomic dna 
was  prepared  from  single  colonies  resuspended  in  100  l 
tris-edta  buffer,  heated  at  95oc  for  5  min  and 
centrifuged  briefly.  the  supernatant  (2.0  l)  was  used  for 
pcr (25 l final volume).  
amplified  ribosomal  dna  restriction  analysis 
(ardra) 
genomic  dna  was  isolated  from  a  single  colony  grown 
overnight  in  lb  broth  by  using  wizard  genomic  kit 
(promega,  madison,  wi,  usa).  16s  rrna  genes  were

30  sec,  55oc  for  30  sec,  72oc  for  45  sec,  plus  a  final 
extension  at  72oc  for  7  min.  the  pcr  products  were 
digested with the endonucleases mspi and hhai (promega, 
madison,  wi,  usa),  according  to  the  protocols  of  the 
manufacturer. ardra profiles (5 l of digested 16s rrna

isolation of herbicide-degrading bacteria 
the isolation of native simazine-degrading bacterial strains 
was performed by batch enrichment cultivation. 10 g of soil 
(dry  weight  basis)  was  inoculated  in  90  ml  of  atrazine 
medium  (am)  (rousseaux  et  al.  2001),  using  commercial 
simazine as sole nitrogen source. cycloheximide (50 mg/l) 
was added to the medium to inhibit eukaryotic cell growth. 
cultures  were  incubated  at  28oc  with  orbital  agitation. 
enrichment  cultures  were  subcultured  and  isolates  were 
obtained by spread plating on am agar with simazine (2.5 
mm). colonies on am agar were purified and maintained 
on  this  medium.  strains  were  stored  at  -24oc.  the 
culturable heterotrophic bacteria of soils were estimated by 
plating on tryptic soy agar (tsa) plates.  
physiological and biochemical characterization 
the  isolates  were  characterized  by  conventional  methods: 
gram staining, catalase and oxidase activities and motility.

identification  of  bacterial  strains  by  16s  rrna 
gene sequence analysis 
dna was extracted using the bio101 dna kit for bacteria 
(qiagen, hilden, germany). for pcr amplification of 16s 
rrna  genes,  the  27f  and  1492r  primers  were  used. 
amplification reaction was performed with a dna engine 
ptc-200  peltier  thermal  cycler 
(mj  research, 
massachusetts, usa), with the following program: 1 cycle 
of 95oc for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95oc for 45 sec; 55oc for 45 
sec; 72oc for 2 min; followed by a final extension at 72oc 
for  10  min.  amplification  products  were  visualized  after 
separation  by  electrophoresis  in  a  1%  agarose  gel  and 
staining  with  ethidium  bromide.  pcr  16s  rrna  genes 
were purified, using qiaquick columns and the protocol of 
the  manufacturer 
(qiagen,  hilden,  germany),  and 
sequenced  directly,  using  a  taq  dyedeoxy  terminator 
cycle  sequencing  kit,  version  3.1,  an  abi  model  3100 
dna  sequencer  and  the  protocols  of  the  manufacturer 
(applied biosystems inc., foster city, ca, usa). 
results and discussion 
isolation of s-triazine-degrading bacteria 
the  adaptation  to  long-term  polluted  environmental  sites 
endows  environmental  microbes  with 
the  catabolic 
capabilities for these pollutants. agricultural so ils treated 
with  the  herbicide  simazine  for  more  than  20  years  were 
used  for  isolation  of  bacterial  strains  able  to  degrade  s  -
triazines.  the  number  of  culturable  heterotrophic  bacteria 
from these agricultural soils was 7 x 106 cfu/g of dry soil. 
this  number  was  not  affected  by  simazine  application. 
microbial  communities  from  these  soils  were  enriched 
under  aerobic  conditions  in  am  broth  using  simazine  as 
sole  nitrogen  source.  three  bacterial  isolates  capable  of 
simazine-degradation  were  selected  and  characterized. 
strains  p51  and  p52  were  isolated  from  an  avocado 
plantation  soil,  and  strain  c53  was  isolated  from  a 
persimmon  plantation  soil.  the  bacterial  strains  were 
characterized  by  biochemical  and  physiological  analyses 
(table 1). figure 4 shows the colony morphology on tsa 
medium  and  cell  morphology  observed  by  transmission 
electronic  microscopy  of  strains  p51  and  p52.  the  three 
bacterial strains were grown in lb broth supplemented with 
simazine,  reaching  a  turbidity  600  nm  ~1.2.  degradation  of 

 

simazine by these strains grown in lb broth with simazine 
was studied using resting cell assays. the strains p51 and 
p52 degraded > 80% of simazine (0.5 mm) within 48 hrs, 
while strain c53 removed > 60% of this herbicide (figure 
5). the presence of the catabolic atza and atzd genes was 
analyzed by pcr-amplification using specific primers. the 
atza and atzd genes encode the first enzyme of the upper 
and  lower  s-  triazine  catabolic  pathways  (figure  3), 
respectively (mandelbaum et al. 1995; devers et al. 2007; 
iwasaki  et  al.  2007).  the  atza  and  atzd  genes  were 
detected in strains p51 and c53, while only atzd gene was 
observed in strain p52 (table 2). the isolation of s-triazine-
degrading  bacteria  has  been  reported,  and  atz  genes  have 
been determined in some of these isolates (mandelbaum et 
al. 1995; rousseaux et al. 2001; devers et al. 2007).

novel s-triazine-degrading bacteria isolated from chilean agricultural soils 

ardra  
to further characterize the isolates, comparative analysis of 
the  16s  rrna  gene  restriction  pattern  (ardra)  of  the 
three bacterial strains was performed. this method allows a 
fast  analysis  of  the  16s rrna  gene  sequence  structure  of 
bacterial  strains.  the  pcr-amplified  16s  rrna  genes  of 
the three strains were digested using the restriction enzymes 
msp1  and  hha1.  the  ardra  profiles  of  p51  and  c53 
strains were similar, suggesting that they are closely related 
bacteria.  ardra  indicated  that  strain  p52  is  a  different 
ribotype (figure 6). 
identification of simazine-degrading bacteria 
the  16s rrna  gene  of  the  three  isolates  were  sequenced 
and  analyzed  for  bacterial  identification.  the  strain  c53 
isolated from persimmon plantation and strain p51 isolated 
soil  were  classified  as 
from  avocado  plantation 
proteobacteria, 
order 
xanthomonadales,  family  xanthomonadaceae  and  were 
most  similar  to  genus  stenotrophomonas,  with  a  high 
sequence  similarity  (>98%).  both  strains  c53  and  p51 
differ slightly in their 16s rrna gene sequence. the strain 
p52 isolated from persimmon plantation soil was classified 
as 
order 
actinomycetales,  family  micrococcaceae  and  was  most 
similar  to  genus  arthrobacter  with  a  similarity  >  97% 
(table  2).  s-triazine-degrading  bacterial  strains  belonging 
to  other  genera,  such  as  pseudomonas,  nocardioides  and 
agrobacterium,  have  also  been  reported  (mandelbaum  et 
al. 1995; devers et al. 2007; hernandez et al. 2008b). 
concluding remarks 
three bacterial strains capable to degrade simazine and to 
use it as sole nitrogen source for growth were isolated from 
herbicide-treated  agricultural  soils  of  central  chile.  these 
strains  were  characterized  and  identified.  resting  cells  of 
the  strains  p51,  p52  and  c53  were  able  to  efficiently

p52 and c53. resting cells of cultures previously grown in lb 
broth  with  simazine  were  incubated  with  simazine  (0.5  mm). 
control:  without  cells.  each  value  is  an  average  of  two 
independent experiments. 

 
figure 6. amplified 16s rrna gene restriction analysis of 
3 isolated bacterial strains. the amplified 16s rrna genes 
were digested with restriction enzymes hhai and mspi. dna 
restriction patterns were observed in an agarose gel stained 
with ethidium bromide. mm: molecular mass standards.  
 

to  analyze 

first  enzyme  of  the  upper  and  lower  s-triazine  catabolic 
pathways  were  detected  in  strains  p51  and  c53.  the 
bacterial  strain  p52  possesses  the  atzd  gene.  ardra 
indicated that strain p52 is a different ribotype than strains 
c53 and p51. by sequence analysis of the 16s rrna genes, 
strains  c53 and  p51  were  identified  as stenotrophomonas 
sp.  and  strain  p52  was  identified  as  arthrobacter  sp. 
further  studies  of  these  simazine-degrading  bacteria  are 
required 
their  potential  application  as 
biocatalysts 
environments 
of 
contaminated with s -triazine herbicides.
