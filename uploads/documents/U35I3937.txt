abstract

2-aminophenol (2-ap) is a toxic nitrogen-containing aromatic pollutant. burkholderia xenovorans lb400 possess an amn
gene cluster that encodes the 2-ap catabolic pathway. in this report, the functionality of the 2-aminophenol pathway of b.
xenovorans strain lb400 was analyzed. the amnrjbacdfehg cluster located at chromosome 1 encodes the enzymes for the
degradation of 2-aminophenol. the absence of haba and habb genes in lb400 genome correlates with its no growth on
nitrobenzene. rt-pcr analyses in strain lb400 showed the co-expression of amnjb, amnbac, amnacd, amndfe and
amnehg genes, suggesting that the amn cluster is an operon. rt-qpcr showed that the amnb gene expression was highly
induced by 2-ap, whereas a basal constitutive expression was observed in glucose, indicating that these amn genes are
regulated. we propose that the predicted marr-type transcriptional regulator encoded by the amnr gene acts as repressor
of the amn gene cluster using a marr-type regulatory binding sequence. this report showed that lb400 resting cells
degrade completely 2-ap. the amn gene cluster from strain lb400 is highly identical to the amn gene cluster from p.
knackmussi strain b13, which could not grow on 2-ap. however, we demonstrate that b. xenovorans lb400 is able to grow
using 2-ap as sole nitrogen source and glucose as sole carbon source. an amnba2 mutant of strain lb400 was unable to
grow with 2-ap as nitrogen source and glucose as carbon source and to degrade 2-ap. this study showed that during lb400
growth on 2-ap this substrate was partially converted into picolinic acid (pa), a well-known antibiotic. the addition of pa at
lag or mid-exponential phase inhibited lb400 growth. the mic of pa for strain lb400 is 2 mm. overall, these results
demonstrate that b. xenovorans strain lb400 posses a functional 2-ap catabolic central pathway, which could lead to the
production of picolinic acid.

introduction

several aromatic compounds with nitro and amino groups such
as 2-aminophenol
(2-ap) are toxic and persistent organic
pollutants (pops) in the environment. 2-ap is a compound used
in the production of dyes, plastics and pharmaceuticals, which
could be released in industrial wastewaters, polluting the
environment [1,2]. 2-ap is cytotoxic [3] and has carcinogenic
potential [4]. therefore, the removal of 2-ap is required for the
clean-up of polluted sites. some microorganisms are able to
degrade aerobically 2-ap [1,5].

the aerobic 2-ap metabolic pathway (fig. 1) has been
described in pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes js45, pseudomonas putida
hs12, pseudomonas sp. ap-3 and pseudomonas knackmussii b13 [69].
the enzymes amnba, amnc, amne, amnd, amnf, amng,
amnh are involved in the degradation of 2-ap into pyruvate and
acetyl-coa [1,8,1012]. 2-aminophenol-1,6-dioxygenase (am-

(2-ams). 2-ams is

nab) converts 2-ap through an extradiol meta cleavage into 2-
aminomuconic 6-semialdehyde
further
oxidized by the amnc dehydrogenase into 2-aminomuconic acid
(2-am), which is converted by amnd into 4-oxalocrotonic acid
with a concomitant release of ammonium. 4-oxalocrotonic acid is
further degraded by the enzymes amne, amnf, amng and
amnh into pyruvate and acetyl-coa.

b. xenovorans lb400 is a model bacterium for the degradation of
polychlorobiphenyls (pcbs) and other aromatic compounds [13
15]. its genome comprises a major chromosome (c1), a minor
chromosome (c2) and one megaplasmid (mp) [15]. a wide range
of aromatic compounds including pcbs, hydroxyphenylacetates
and hydroxybenzoates are metabolized by a number of peripheral
catabolic pathways into eleven central catabolic pathways [1417].
strain lb400 possesses the amn genes that encode the enzymes
from the 2-ap central catabolic pathway (fig. 1), but

materials and methods

rna isolation

chemicals

2-aminophenol (99% purity), nitrobenzene (.98% purity) and
picolinic acid (99% purity), were obtained from sigma-aldrich
(saint louis, mo, usa).

bacterial strain and culture conditions

b. xenovorans lb400 was cultivated in luria bertani

(lb)
medium and in nitrogen-free blkn medium [18] using glucose
(10 mm) as sole carbon source at 30uc. for selective growth of
strain lb400, of basal medium agar (oxoid) with glucose 1% (w/
v) and supplemented with bacitracin (0.2 u/ml) and polymyxin b
(0.3 u/ml), and blkn minimal medium agar with nh4cl
(1 mm) and crystal of biphenyl (1 mg) were used.

(10 mm) as

to study growth using 2-ap as carbon and nitrogen source in
liquid media, lb400 cells previously cultured in blkn medium
sole carbon source and nh4cl
using biphenyl
(10 mm) as sole nitrogen source, harvested by centrifugation
and washed twice with sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 m, ph 7.0),
were incubated in blkn minimal medium with benzoate
(10 mm) for 24 h at 30uc on a rotary
(10 mm) and nh4cl
shaker (150 rpm). the cells were harvested by centrifugation,
washed twice with sodium phosphate buffer and suspended in
blkn medium supplemented with glucose (10 mm), 2-ap
(1 mm) or nh4cl (1 mm) in darkness. growth was determined
by measuring turbidity at 525 nm and by counting colony-forming
units (cfu). the cfu were determined using a microdot method
in lb plates and were calculated as the mean 6 sd of at least
three independent experiments. to study the growth of strain
lb400 using 2-ap as nitrogen and carbon source on solid media,
blkn agar with and without glucose (10 mm) was used. 2-ap
crystals (1 mg) and/or an aliquot (5 ml) of nitrobenzene (1 m)
were added. the plates were inoculated with lb400 cells and
incubated at 30uc for 48 h.

minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of pa for strain
lb400 was determined by mueller-hinton broth (difco, detroit,
usa) microdilution at 56105 cfu/ml according to clinical and
laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines [19]. mueller-
hinton medium was supplemented with pa in the concentration
range from 0.032 mm (4 mg/ml)
to 4.159 mm (512 mg/ml):
0.032, 0.065, 0.130, 0.260, 0.520, 1.040, 2.079 and 4.159 mm.
mic for pa was the lowest concentration at which no lb400
growth was observed. mic analysis was done in triplicate.

generation of an amnba2 mutant strain by gene
disruption

a b. xenovorans lb400 mutant defective for 2-aminophenol 1,6-
dioxygenase encoded by the amnb and amna genes was constructed
by gene disruption through homologous recombination. for this
purpose, an amnba fragment (430 bp), which was amplified using
the primers ar1 y bf2, was cloned in the pcr2.1-topo cloning
vector. resulting plasmid pcr2.1amnba was digested with
ecori, and the ecori fragment of pcr2.1amnba was cloned
into ecori site of pk18mobsacb and introduced into e. coli
cc118 [lpir] prior to selection for km-resistance clones carrying
amnba fragment. resulting plasmid pk18mobsacbamnba was
transferred into b. xenovorans lb400 by triparental mating with e.
coli hbh101 (prk600) as helper strain [20]. km-resistance
colonies able to utilize biphenyl as sole carbon source were

total rna was isolated from lb400 cells using an rneasy mini
kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) according to the manufacturers
recommendations. dnase i treatment was carried out using the
rnase-free dnase set (qiagen, hilden, germany) to degrade any
residual dna. amplification of 16s rrna gene and amnb gene
using specific primer sets (table 1) were used as controls to exclude
dna contamination. the rna concentration was quantified
using a qubit fluorometer (invitrogen) and a nanodrop spectro-
photometer (thermo scientific). rna integrity was tested by
agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis.

rt-pcr and real-time rt-pcr

reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) was carried out with
sequence-specific primers design in this study (table 1) by using
superscript one-step rt-pcr with platinum taq (invitrogen,
carlsbad, usa). the co-expression assays were performed using
the primers indicated in table 1. the cycles of amplification (35
cycles) was carried outs as follows: 95uc for 1 min, 60uc for
0.5 min, 72uc for 2 min, after an initial denaturation at 95uc for
5 min. negative and positive controls were included in each rt-
pcr assay. at least two independent rt-pcr reactions for each
condition were done to assess reproducibility.

for rt-qpcr, total rna (100 ng) was transcribed with verso
cdna kit (thermo scientific, lafayette, usa). the rt-qpcr
was performed according to the miqe guidelines [21]. real-time
pcr was performed on mx3000p qpcr system (stratagene),
using the kapa sybr fast qpcr master mix (26) universal kit
(kapabiosystems, boston, usa) and 0.3 mm of each primer.
samples were initially denatured at 95uc for 5 min. a 40-cycle
amplification and quantification protocol (95uc for 15 s, 62uc for
15 s and 72uc for 15 s) with a single fluorescence measurement
per cycle followed by a melting-curve program (95uc for 15 s,
25uc for 0.1 s, 70uc for 15 s and 95uc for 0.1 s) were used
according to manufacturers recommendations. the pcr melting
curves confirm the amplification of a single product for each
primer pair. the bf2 and br1 primers were used for amnb gene
amplification, yielding a product of 208 bp. the ftsz (bxea0491)
gene was amplified as a reference gene, yielding an amplicon of
113 bp. a standard curve in triplicate was made with 5 serial
dilutions (10 fold) for each amplicon in a linear range (9.2 ng 
0.09 pg) of lb400 genomic dna. qpcr efficiencies were
calculated from the slopes of
the
calibration curves, using the equation e = 10(21/slope). the qpcr
efficiency rate was 1.95 for both amnb and ftsz genes. the ftsz
gene was
stably expressed according to the algorithms of
bestkeeper [22]. relative amnb gene expression ratios were
determined by the pfaffl method [23], normalizing the gene
expression to lb400 cells grown in blkn medium with glucose as
sole carbon source and nh4cl as sole nitrogen source.

acetate (0.1 m) solution. the flow rate was 1 ml min21. 2-ap was
quantified using calibration curves with authentic standards.
resting cells experiments were performed in triplicate.

metabolism of 2-ap

lb400 cells grown in blkn medium were incubated in
presence of 2-ap (1 mm) in darkness at 30uc. aliquots (2 ml)
were collected by centrifuged (19,2836g for 2 min) at different
times and cell-free supernatants were analyzed by reverse phase
chromatography with a jasco liquid chromatograph equipped with
a diode array detector and a whatman c-18 column (25 cm by
4.6 mm id). the aqueous mobile phase contained 20% methanol,
20% acetonitrile and 0.1% phosphoric acid and the flow rate was
1.0 ml min21. the compounds were monitored at 278 nm.
under these conditions, 2-ap and picolinic acid have retention
times of 4.56 and 3.73 min, respectively. 2-ap and picolinic acid
were quantified using commercial authentic standards.

bioinformatics analysis

the amn genes and the neighborhood in the genome of strain
lb400 was analyzed using the vector nti suite 9.0 software. for
the sequence alignment the database of the national center for
biotechnology information (ncbi/blast home) (http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi) was used. clustal w software was used
for analysis of the sequence of amnb gene with selected sequences
retrieved from genbank. the software package mega 5.0 [24]
was used for phylogenetic analyses. a phylogenetic tree was built
by using the neighbor-joining method with a bootstrap analysis of
5000.

bioinformatic analysis of the amn genes in b. xenovorans
strain lb400

the amn genes from b. xenovorans lb400 are clustered at c1
(fig. 2). the amn gene cluster includes the bxea1143, bxea1144,
bxea1145, bxea1146, bxea1147, bxea1148, bxea1149,
bxea1150, bxea1151 and bxea1152 genes (hereafter amnr,
amnj, amnb, amna, amnc, amnd, amnf, amne, amnh and amng genes,
respectively) and has an extension of 8,529 bp. the predicted amn
genes of strain lb400 are listed in table 2. the amnrjbacd-
fehg gene cluster encodes the enzymes of the catabolic pathway
for the conversion of 2-aminophenol into pyruvate and acetyl-coa
(fig. 1). the amnba genes encode the 2-aminophenol-1,6-
dioxygenase that open the 2-aminophenol ring via meta-cleavage,
producing 2-ams. the predicted amnc gene encodes 2-amino-
muconic-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase that oxidizes 2-ams into
2-am. the amnd gene encodes the enzyme 2-aminomuconic
deaminase that converts 2-am into 4-oxalocrotonic acid and
ammonium, which could be used as nitrogen source for bacterial
growth. the predicted amne encodes
the 4-oxalocrotonate
decarboxylase, which converts 4-oxalocrotonate into 2-keto-4-
pentenoate. the amnf gene encodes 2-keto-4-pentenoate hydra-
tase that oxidizes 2-keto-4-pentenoate into 4-hidroxy-2-ketopen-
tanoate. the predicted amng gene encodes 4-hidroxy-2-ketovale-
rate aldolase that degrades 4-hidroxy-2-ketopentanoate into
pyruvate and acetaldehyde. the amnh gene encodes the enzyme
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase for the final conversion of acetalde-
hyde into acetyl-coa. the amnr and amnj genes are also present
in the amn gene cluster from strain lb400. the amnr gene encodes
a marr-type transcriptional regulator, which probably acts as
transcriptional repressor of the amn gene cluster. the amnj gene is

present in diverse bacterial amn gene clusters, suggesting that its
product is required for the 2-ap biochemical pathway. gaillard
et al. [9] proposed that amnj is a ferredoxin-like protein. we have
observed that the amnj protein has a conserved domain from the
yjgf super family proteins that have enamine/imine deaminase
activity [2526].

the genetic neighborhood of the amn gene cluster in strain
lb400 was analyzed. the genes located upstream (between
bxea1142 and bxea1131 (clcr) genes) and downstream (between
bxea1153 and bxea1157) of the amn gene cluster were studied
(fig. 2a). diverse transcriptional regulator genes are located
upstream of the amn gene cluster. the bxea1141, bxea1138,
bxea1137, bxea1136, bxea1135 and bxea1134 genes encode a
tetr-type transcriptional regulator closely related to a tetr-type
regulator from rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae usda 2370
(accession number ejb01162.1; 56% identity), a tetr-type
transcriptional regulator closely related to a tetr-type regulator
protein from acidovorax sp. js42 (abm43064.1; 93% identity), a
marr-type transcriptional regulator closely related to a marr-
type regulator protein from acidovorax sp. js42 (abm43065.1; 77%
identity), a lysr-type transcriptional regulator closely related to a
lysr-type regulator protein from bordetella petrii dsm 12804
(cap41606.1; 81% identity), a xre-type transcriptional regulator

cluster

encode membrane

closely related to a xre regulator protein from alcaligenes sp.
hpc1271 (eku29625.1; 86% identity), and a lysr-type tran-
scriptional regulator closely related to a lysr-type regulator
protein from acidovorax delafieldii 2an (eer60975.1; 67% identity),
respectively (fig. 2). three genes located downstream of the amn
gene
transporter proteins. the
bxea1155, bxea1156 and bxea1157 genes encode three com-
ponents (an outer membrane protein, an inner membrane protein
and a transmembrane protein, respectively) of a major facilitator
superfamily (mfs) multidrug efflux system. this multidrug efflux
system possesses high identity with a multidrug efflux transporter
pump from ralstonia solanacearum gmi1000 [27],
including the
channel-forming component
(cad17593.1; 54% identity), the
inner membrane protein (cad17592.1; 58% identity) and the
transmembrane protein (cad17591.1; 57% identity), respectively.
the bxea1154 gene encodes a trag conjugal transfer coupling
protein that has 33% identity with the trag protein (accession
number aft71063.1) from alcanivorax dieselolei b5 [28].

the analysis of the genetic organization of the amn genes in
bacteria indicate a conserved amnjbacd gene cluster encoding
enzymes for the conversion of 2-ap until 4-oxalocrotonate, and
amnfehg genes encoding enzymes involved in the transformation
of 4-oxalocrotonate into acetyl-coa. regulation of the amn gene

membrane protein from mfs multidrug efflux system; bxea1157, transmembrane protein from mfs multidrug efflux system. the sizes of the genes
and the intergenic regions are on scale. b, comparison of bacterial amn gene clusters. the amn sequences (accession number) are: b. xenovorans

cluster is generally mediated by an amnr gene-encoded mar-type
family transcriptional regulator located upstream of the amn gene
cluster. b. xenovorans lb400, p. knackmussii b13 [9] and bordetella
avium 197n [29] shared the amnrjbacd gene organization (fig. 2).
p. putida strains hs12 and w619 shared the amnrjbac gene
cluster, whereas the amnd gene is located after the amnfe genes. p.
pseudoalcaligenes strain js45 and pseudomonas sp. strain ap-3 showed
a similar amnbac gene organization, but in these strains the amnr
gene and amnrj genes have not been reported (fig. 2). in
pseudomonas sp. strain ap-3 the amnd gene is located between amnf
and amne genes. comamonas testosteroni strain cnb-1 possesses a
similar gene cluster for the 2-amino-5-chlorophenol catabolism
[30]. the cnbjbacd gene cluster that encodes the enzymes for the
conversion of 2-amino-5-cholorophenol into 4-oxalocrotonate has
the same gene organization (fig. 2). the genetic organization of
amnfehg genes, which encode the enzymes for the conversion of
4-oxolocrotonate into acetyl-coa and is conserved in other
bacteria, is located in b. xenovorans strain lb400 downstream of
the amnrjbacd gene cluster. however,
in pseudomonas strains
hs12, w619 and ap-3, the amnd gene is located within the
amnfegh cluster (fig. 2). the amnfegh region has not been
reported in the amn gene cluster of p. pseudoalcaligenes strain js45.
the nitrobenzene catabolic peripheral pathway funnels into the
2-aminophenol central pathway in bacteria. the haba and habb
genes
involved in the conversion of
nitrobenzene into 2-aminophenol are absent in the genome of b.
xenovorans lb400. in the 2-ap-degraders p. putida hs12 and p.
pseudoalcaligenes js45 the hab genes are located distantly from the
amn gene cluster (fig. 2). in accordance with the absence of the hab
genes, strain lb400 was unable to grow using nitrobenzene as sole
nitrogen or carbon source.

that encode enzymes

the phylogenetic sequence analysis of the 2-aminophenol 1,6-
dioxygenase amnb b-subunits and related class iii ring-cleavage
dioxygenases is illustrated in figure 3. the 2-aminophenol 1,6-
dioxygenase b-subunits were clustered in two branches. one
branch includes the amnb proteins of b. xenovorans lb400, p.
knackmussii b13, b. avium 197n and achromobacter xylosoxidans a8.
the second branch comprises 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase b-
subunits from pseudomonas sp. ap-3, p. putida w619, p. putida hs12
and p. pseudoalcaligenes js45. this sequence analyses suggest that
amnb protein of b. xenovorans lb400 evolved separately from
amnb protein of pseudomonas sp ap-3 and p. pseudoalcaligenes strain
js45. this is in accordance with the genetic organization of amn
gene clusters (fig. 2). the gene organization of amnjrbacd
cluster of b. xenovorans strain lb400, p. knackmussii b13, b. avium
197n is identical, and their amnb enzymes were classified in the
same branch in the phylogenetic tree. p. pseudoalcaligenes js45 and
pseudomonas sp ap-3 showed a different amn gene cluster than b.
xenovorans
strain lb400 and also their amnb proteins were
classified in a different phylogenetic branch. the amnb proteins
are closely related to the 2-amino-5-chlorophenol-1,6-dioxygenase
cnbcb proteins that oxidizes 4-chloro-2-aminophenol, but less
related to dioxygenases subunits involved in the oxidation of 3,4-
dihydroxyphenylacetate and 29-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol. all these
dioxygenases
shared a common ancestor with catechol 2,3-
dioxygenase nahh and xyle proteins. phenoxazinone synthases,
which use the same substrate as amnb proteins, are closely related
to catechol 1,2-dioxygenases but not related to 2-aminophenol 1,6-
dioxygenase amnb b-subunits.

transcription of the amn genes

the transcription of the amn genes in strain lb400 was studied
using specific primer sets (fig. 4a). to study the co-expression of
the amn genes, diverse primers sets were designed to amplify

2-aminophenol metabolism by b. xenovorans lb400

adjacent genes. rt-pcr of mrna from lb400 cells grown until
exponential phase in blkn medium with glucose and 2-ap as
sole carbon and nitrogen sources were performed. the expression
of the amnr gene in strain lb400 was observed (fig. 4b). two
divergent s70-type promoters were identified in the amn gene
cluster, which are located between the amnr gene and the amnj
gene. rt-pcr analyses showed the co-expression for amnjb,
amnbac, amnacd, amndfe and amnehg genes (fig. 4b), indicat-
ing that the amn gene cluster is an operon in strain lb400. the co-
expression of the amn genes strongly suggests that the promoter
located upstream of the amnj gene permits the expression of an
amnjbacdfehg single transcript. a putative marr-type regula-
tory binding sequence (tagtacgtatacgtttca) was iden-
the amnjbacdfehg gene cluster, which
tified upstream of
showed a consensus marr-type regulator binding sequence (59-
tag(g/t)acgtatacgtacta-39)
located upstream of the
amnj gene from diverse 2-ap-degrading bacteria: p. putida w619,
c. testosteroni cnb1, p. pseudoalcaligenes js45, p. knackmussii b13 and
bordetella avium 197n. the amnb gene encodes the 2-aminophenol
1,6-dioxygenase beta subunit, which is the key enzyme of 2-ap
catabolic pathway. the expression of amnb gene in lb400 cells
grown in glucose in presence or absence of 2-ap and nitrobenzene
was studied. real time rt-pcr analysis showed that the amnb
gene has a basal expression during growth in glucose. the amnb
gene expression was highly induced by 2-ap, whereas lower
induction was observed in cells during exposure to 2-ap and
glucose (fig. 4c). the lowest induction of amnb gene expression
was observed in cells during exposure to nitrobenzene. overall
these results indicate a regulated expression of the amn gene cluster
in strain lb400.

2-aminophenol degradation

to further characterize the 2-ap catabolic pathway, 2-
aminophenol degradation by strain lb400 was studied. resting
lb400 cells were incubated with 2-ap. lb400 cells degrade 15%
of 2-ap after 6 h of incubation, whereas complete degradation was
observed after 30 h (fig. 5). in contrast, 2-ap was not degraded by
boiled lb400 cells. the amnba2 mutant of strain lb400 is not
able to degrade 2-ap, indicating that 2-aminophenol-1,6-dioxy-
genase is the sole enzyme involved in 2-ap degradation in strain
lb400.

growth of strain lb400 on 2-aminophenol

the expression of the amn genes and the degradation of 2-ap,
suggest a functional 2-ap catabolic pathway in b. xenovorans strain
lb400. in a further analysis of this metabolic pathway, the growth
of strain lb400 in minimal medium with 2-ap as nitrogen or
carbon source was studied. in a first approach, the growth of strain
lb400 on blkn agar plates in presence of 2-aminophenol
crystals in absence or presence of glucose was studied. small
colonies of lb400 cells grown around the 2-ap crystals used as
sole nitrogen source or as sole carbon and nitrogen source on
blkn plates were observed (data not shown). an increased
number of small colonies around the 2-ap crystals on plates with
2-ap and supplemented with nitrobenzene was observed,
suggesting that nitrobenzene stimulate growth probably by the
induction of
the 2-ap catabolic pathway genes. these small
colonies were phenotypically confirmed as b. xenovorans lb400.
the bacteria of the colonies were able to grow in minimal medium
supplemented with biphenyl as sole carbon and energy source and
show typical colonies on ofbpl medium agar (data not shown).
in contrast, no colonies were observed on plates with nitrobenzene
as sole carbon and nitrogen source (data not shown).

glucose as carbon source was observed (fig. 6a). however, the
cells reached lower biomass than cells incubated with nh4cl as
sole nitrogen source and glucose as sole carbon source. these
results suggest that an inhibitory metabolite was produced during
lb400 growth on 2-ap and glucose. lb400 cells showed a
minimal growth using 2-ap as sole carbon and nitrogen source,
which was similar to growth on glucose in absence of a nitrogen
source, suggesting that in absence of other carbon and nitrogen
source, 2-ap could be used as carbon source, but not as nitrogen
source. no lb400 growth was observed in presence of nh4cl and
absence of a carbon source (fig. 6a). to link the lb400 growth on
2-ap with the amn-encoded catabolic pathway, the growth on 2-
ap of an amnba2 mutant derivative of b. xenovorans lb400
generated by homologous
studied. the
amnba2 mutant was unable to grow in blkn medium with 2-
ap as sole nitrogen source and glucose as carbon source, which
correlates with no degradation of 2-ap (data not shown).

recombination was

to study if during the degradation of 2-ap by strain lb400 a
toxic metabolite was produced,
the supernatants of cultures
mentioned above were analyzed by hplc. 2-ap was degraded
during the first 15 h, independently if 2-ap was used as nitrogen
or as carbon source (fig. 6b). interestingly, 2-ap degradation
correlates with the production of a metabolite. this metabolite was
identified as picolinic acid (pa) by comparison of its absorption
spectrum and hplc retention time with an authentic standard.
picolinic acid could be produced by a spontaneous non-enzymatic
reaction than convert 2-ams into pa. 2-ams is produced from 2-

ap by the 2-aminophenol-1,6-dioxygenase. during 2-ap degra-
dation only partial conversion into pa was observed. the maximal
pa concentration reached during growth using 2-ap (1 mm) as
carbon source or as carbon and nitrogen source was approxi-
mately 0.5 mm, which correlates with a low cell growth. when 2-
ap was used as sole nitrogen source a higher biomass was reached
whereas a lower pa concentration (0.25 mm) was observed.

figure 7 illustrate the effects of 2-ap and pa on b. xenovorans
strain lb400 growth. lb400 growth on glucose and nh4cl was
not affected by the addition of 2-ap at late exponential phase
(fig. 7a). in contrast, when 2-ap was present since lag phase, a
low cell density was reached at stationary phase. these results
suggest that 2-ap has to be metabolized to exert an inhibitory
effect on lb400 growth. on the other side, the effect of the
addition of pa on lb400 growth was studied (fig. 7b). the
addition of pa at the lag phase reduced significantly the biomass
reached at exponential phase of lb400 culture growing with
glucose and nh4cl. however,
late
exponential phase did not affect the cell growth. the addition of
2-ap or pa at mid-exponential phase of lb400 cultures growing
with glucose and nh4cl inhibited also the cell growth (fig. 7c).
finally, the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of pa for b.
xenovorans strain lb400 was measured. the mic of pa that
prevented lb400 growth was 2 mm.

discussion

this study revealed that the 2-aminophenol catabolic central
pathway is functional in the model aromatic-degrading bacterium
b. xenovorans lb400. strain lb400 is able to use 2-ap as sole
nitrogen source for growth, indicating an active 2-ap catabolic
central pathway. only few bacterial strains capable to grow on 2-
ap have yet been reported [5,6]. pseudomonas sp. strain ap-3 is able
to grow in liquid medium using 2-ap as sole carbon and nitrogen
source [5]. p. pseudoalcaligens strain js45 grow in liquid medium
using 2-ap as sole carbon and nitrogen source but only when the
cells were previously induced with nb [6]. in contrast,
the
nitrobenzene-degrader pseudomonas putida strain hs12 did not
grow on 2-ap [7]. interestingly, p. knackmussi strain b13 that share
a highly identical amn gene cluster with b. xenovorans lb400 is not
able to grow on 2-ap [9]. in our study, strain lb400 reached
lower cell numbers in liquid medium using as sole nitrogen source
for growth 2-ap (2.56108 cfu ml21) than ammonium chloride
(4.56108 cfu ml21). on the other side, only minimal growth of
strain lb400 was measured in liquid medium with 2-ap as sole
nitrogen and carbon source. in addition, small colonies of strain
lb400 were observed on agar plates using 2-ap crystals as sole
nitrogen and carbon source. all these results indicate a reduced
growth of strain lb400 on 2-ap, suggesting an inhibition of cell
growth during the metabolism of 2-ap. the growth inhibition
suggests the production of a toxic metabolite. in this study, we
were able to demonstrate that during the degradation of 2-ap by
strain lb400 this substrate is partially converted into the antibiotic
picolinic acid. when 2-ap (1 mm) was used as sole carbon and

nitrogen source for strain lb400 growth, high levels of pa
(0.5 mm) were produced. in this report we showed that pa
inhibited the growth of b. xenovorans strain lb400. the mic of pa
for strain lb400 is 2 mm. pa is a well known antibiotic for gram-
negative bacteria such as p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus,
mycobacterium avium complex and fungi such as candida albicans [31
and zn2+
33]. pa is a chelating agent for metals ions such as fe2+
.
interestingly, it has been reported that pa induces antitumoral
activity of macrophages and chromium picolinate has been used as
a dietary supplement for obese persons to promote weight loss
[3136]. nishino and spain [6] reported that crude extracts of p.
pseudoalcaligenes strain js45 transformed 2-ap through 2-ams into
pa. the addition of nad to the extracts of strain js45 prevented
the formation of pa by favoring the formation of 2-aminomuco-
nate by the 2-aminomuconic-6-semialdehide dehydrogenase
amnc. for the production of pa, a recombinant e. coli strain
harboring only the genes for 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase from
strain js45 was used for the biotransformation of 2-ap into pa
[37]. p. knackmussi strain b13 that has a highly identical 2-ap
catabolic pathway as strain lb400 did not grow on 2-ap [9]. to
explain the failure of strain b13 growth on 2-ap, gaillard et al.
proposed the production of a toxic intermediate from 2-ap or
alternatively a metabolic misrouting. our study demonstrates the
conversion of 2-ap into pa by the amn-encoded catabolic pathway
in b. xenovorans strain lb400. these results suggest that strain b13
also produces the toxic pa during 2-ap degradation, impeding its
growth on 2-ap. the biotransformation of aromatic compounds
into toxic metabolites and antibiotics has been reported [3841].

and contains genes of
the 2-aminophenol and chlorocatechol
catabolic pathways and genes involved in the transport of aromatic
compounds. the amn gene clusters from b. xenovorans lb400 and p.
knackmussii strain b13 have the same amn gene organization and
the amn genes of both strains have almost identical gene sequence
[9], which strongly suggest horizontal gene transfer of the amn gene
cluster between bacteria. genome analysis of
strain lb400
indicates the absence of nbz (hab) genes involved in the conversion
of nitrobenzene into 2-aminophenol. in accordance with the
genome analysis,
strain lb400 was unable to grow using
nitrobenzene as sole nitrogen or carbon source. in contrast, both
2-ap-degrading pseudomonas strains js45 and hs12 possess the
nbza (haba) and nbzb (habb) genes for nitrobenzene degradation
and are able to grown on nitrobenzene as carbon and nitrogen
energy source [6,42].

the 2-aminophenol-1,6-dioxygenase amnb subunit of b.
xenovorans lb400 is closely related to amnb of p. knackmussi strain
b13 (100% identity) and ligb of b. avium 197n (89% identity). 2-
aminophenol-1,6-dioxygenase belong to the extradiol dioxy-
genases [8,43] that include also the 2-amino-5-chlorophenol-1,6-
dioxigenase and the catechol-2,3-dioxygenase. the substrates of
these related extradiol dioxygenases comprise catechol, 29-
aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol, 3,4-dihydroxybiphenylacetate, 2-amino-
5-chlorophenol and 2-aminophenol, suggesting the evolution of
these catabolic enzymes. the extradiol dioxygenases are classified
in two branches. the enzymes of substrates with a catechol group
such as 29-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenases and 3,4-
dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenases are closely related to
catechol 2,3-dioxygenases. the extradiol dioxygenases
that
recognize substrate in which one hydroxyl group of the catechol
moiety has been replaced by an amino group are most distantly
related to the catechol 2,3-dioxygenases. the 2-aminophenol-1,6-

dioxigenase amnb of pseudomonas sp. strain ap3 is closely related
to 2-amino-5-chlorophenol-1,6-dioxigenase cnbcb subunit of c.
testosteroni strain cnb-1 (70% identity). in addition, the organiza-
tion of the cnb gene cluster of c. testosteroni cnb-1 and the amn gene
cluster of p. putida hs12 is conserved, suggesting a common origin.
the phenoxazinone synthase (grif, phsa or nspf) of several
members of the streptomyces genus that use also 2-ap as substrate
are not related to 2-aminophenol-1,6-dioxygenase [44]. this is not
surprising since phenoxazinone oxidase is not an extradiol
dioxygenase.

in this study, we showed that b. xenovorans strain lb400 grew
using 2-ap as sole nitrogen source and that lb400 cells degraded
completely 2-ap. in contrast, an amnba2 mutant was unable to
grow on 2-ap as nitrogen source and to degrade this compound,
linking the amn-encoded central pathway with 2-ap catabolism in
strain lb400. in addition, rt-pcr analysis showed that amna,
amnb, amnc, amnd, amne, amnf, amng, amnh, amnj and amnr genes
were expressed in lb400 cells. these results demonstrate that the
amn gene cluster is functional. the co-expression of the amnjb,
amnbac, amnacd, amndfe and amnehg genes and the presence
of a promoter upstream of the amnj gene indicate that the amn
genes are clustered in an operon. the expression of the amnb gene
in lb400 cells grown in glucose indicates a basal expression of the
amn gene. the amnb gene expression is highly induced by 2-ap,
whereas lower induction was observed in presence of 2-ap and
glucose. these results suggest an induction of the amnb gene
transcription by 2-ap or its metabolic intermediates and a down
regulation of its transcription by glucose. in accordance with the
regulation of the amn genes observed in our study, transcriptional
analysis with a dna chip showed a higher expression of the amn
genes of strain lb400 in benzoate than in succinate [45]. the

of strain lb400 is probably a transcriptional repressor of the amn
gene cluster. marr-type transcriptional
regulators bind as
dimmers
to palindromic sequences within the promoter. a
regulatory palindromic sequence was observed in the intergenic
region of the amnr gene and the amnjbacdfehg gene cluster
from strain lb400. marr regulators bind to dna in absence of
the specific ligand, causing generally transcriptional repression
[46]. p. knackmussi strain b13 showed by dot blot hybridization a
basal amnb gene expression in glucose and a 50-fold increase amnb
gene expression in 2-ap (1 mm) and anthranilate (1 mm) [9]. p.
putida hs12 down regulated the amn genes in succinate [7]. in
contrast, pseudomonas sp. strain ap3 expresses constitutively the amn
genes [8], which correlates with the absence of the amnr gene in its
amn gene cluster.

figure 1 illustrates the predicted functional 2-ap catabolic
pathway of the model bacterium b. xenovorans strain lb400. 2-
aminophenol-1,6-dioxygenase encoded by the amnba genes meta-
cleaved 2-aminophenol into 2-ams. the amnba2 mutant is not
able to degrade 2-ap, indicating that 2-aminophenol-1,6-dioxy-
genase is the sole enzyme involved in 2-ap degradation in strain
lb400. 2-ams is further oxidized by 2-aminomuconic-6-semi-
aldehyde dehydrogenase amnc into 2-am. alternatively, 2-ams
could chemically rearrange into pa (fig. 1). the 2-am is
deaminated by 2-aminomuconic deaminase amnd releasing 4-

this step could be used as nitrogen source for bacterial growth. 4-
oxalocrotonate is converted into pyruvate, acetaldehyde and
acetil-coa, by catabolic enzymes that are also involved in the
catechol metabolism.

in conclusion, this study indicates that b. xenovorans strain lb400
possess a functional 2-ap catabolic pathway, which channel the
aromatic pollutant 2-ap into the krebs cycle. interestingly, the 2-
ap degradation in strain lb400 could lead to the production of
the antibiotic picolinic acid, which inhibits
its growth. the
versatile catabolic repertoire for aromatic compounds of b.
xenovorans lb400 allows the degradation of aromatic pollutants
with chloro or amino substituents such as pcbs and 2-ap, which
could be useful for bioremediation studies.
