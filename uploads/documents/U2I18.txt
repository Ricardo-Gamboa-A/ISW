abstract

background: copper mining has led to cu pollution in agricultural soils. in this report, the effects of cu pollution
on bacterial communities of agricultural soils from valparaiso region, central chile, were studied. denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of the 16s rrna genes was used for the characterization of bacterial
communities from cu-polluted and non-polluted soils. cu-resistant bacterial strains were isolated from cu-polluted
soils and characterized.
results: dgge showed a similar high number of bands and banding pattern of the bacterial communities from
cu-polluted and non-polluted soils. the presence of copa genes encoding the multi-copper oxidase that confers
cu-resistance in bacteria was detected by pcr in metagenomic dna from the three cu-polluted soils, but not in
the non-polluted soil. the number of cu-tolerant heterotrophic cultivable bacteria was significantly higher in
cu-polluted soils than in the non-polluted soil. ninety two cu-resistant bacterial strains were isolated from three
cu-polluted agricultural soils. five isolated strains showed high resistance to copper (mic ranged from 3.1 to
4.7 mm) and also resistance to other heavy metals. 16s rrna gene sequence analyses indicate that these isolates
belong to the genera sphingomonas, stenotrophomonas and arthrobacter. the sphingomonas sp. strains o12, a32
and a55 and stenotrophomonas sp. c21 possess plasmids containing the cu-resistance copa genes. arthrobacter sp.
o4 possesses the copa gene, but plasmids were not detected in this strain. the amino acid sequences of copa
from sphingomonas isolates (o12, a32 and a55), stenotrophomonas strain (c21) and arthrobacter strain (o4) are
closely related to copa from sphingomonas, stenotrophomonas and arthrobacter strains, respectively.
conclusions: this study suggests that bacterial communities of agricultural soils from central chile exposed to
long-term cu-pollution have been adapted by acquiring cu genetic determinants. five bacterial isolates showed
high copper resistance and additional resistance to other heavy metals. detection of copa gene in plasmids of four
cu-resistant isolates indicates that mobile genetic elements are involved in the spreading of cu genetic
determinants in polluted environments.

background
copper is widely distributed in nature and it is often
found in the earths crust. cu is an essential trace elem-
ent for living organism, playing a role in an important
number of biological processes [1,2]. the properties of
the metallic form of copper, such as its electricity and
heat conductivity, resistance to corrosion, malleability
and ductility, have been useful for a wide variety of
applications. elevated levels of cu from natural and
industrial sources have been reported in several cu-
producing countries such as chile, china, indonesia,
russia, zambia,
[3-8]. the mining
activities and the use of pesticides to control plant dis-
eases have increased the cu levels in agricultural soils.
cu could bind to soil components (organic matter, clay
minerals, fe, al and mn oxides) leading a significant ac-
cumulation in the soil surface [9]. soil bacteria are
responsible for diverse ecological processes, such as bio-
chemical cycling of the elements, plant growth, decom-
position of organic matter, maintenance of soil structure,
detoxification and pest control [10-13]. cu accumulation
could induce harmful effects on soil bacteria damaging
the biological processes and the soil quality [10,14,15].

techniques

culture independent molecular

such as
dgge have been used to study microbial communities.
dgge is based on an amplification step with specific pri-
mers to amplify a specific gene (for example, a highly vari-
able region of the 16s rrna gene) and a denaturing
gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. studies of soil
bacterial community by dgge revealed that heavy metal
contamination in agricultural soils close to copper and zinc
smelters may provoke changes in the composition of soil
bacterial community and a decrease of the bacterial diver-
sity [11,16]. however, changes in the soil bacterial commu-
nity exposed to heavy metal may vary depending of soil
properties, heavy metal bioavailability and the indigenous
microbial groups in soil [9].

the genes conferring copper resistance in bacteria are
often present in plasmids and organized in an operon
[17-19]. the copper resistance is encoded by the cop
genes (copa, copb, copc and copd)
in cupriavidus
metallidurans ch34, pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato
pt23, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria e3c5
and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and by the pco
genes (pcoa, pcob, pcoc and pcod) in escherichia coli
strain rj92 [20-24]. the copa gene encoding a multi-
copper oxidase (pcoa gene in e. coli) is one of the main
genetic determinants involved in cu-resistance in gram-
negative bacteria. it encodes the multi-copper oxidase
that oxidase cu(i) to the less toxic chemical form of cu
(ii) [1,25,26]. a different copa gene that encodes a cu-
transporting p-type atpase involved in cu homeostasis
has been described in e. coli and other bacteria [17].
the copa gene encoding a multi-copper oxidase is

widely present in cu-resistant bacterial strains and may
represent a relevant marker to study the cu-resistance
in bacteria [26]. the aims of this study were to investi-
gate the effect of long-term cu pollution on the bacterial
community and the characterization of cu-resistant bac-
teria from agricultural sites located close to copper smel-
ters from the aconcagua valley, central chile.

soil sampling
three composite soil samples were collected from four
different agricultural sites in valparaiso region (central
chile). each composite sample contained 12 bulk soil
cores from the surface stratum (010 cm depth) taken
from three sampling points located in an area of 250 m2
per site. the three cu-polluted sites were located in the
neighborhood of an active or an abandoned cu smelter
in the aconcagua valley (figure 1). these soils were
sampled from a pasture soil located in north chagres
(longitude 70o5729.95 w and latitude 32o4637.42 s),
an artichoke plantation soil from south chagres (longi-
tude 70o5757.169 w and latitude 32o4830.254 s)
located 3.5 km distant from north chagres site and an
olive
(longitude
70o5440.628 w and latitude 32o4144.577 s) located
10.8 and 13.5 km distant from north and south chagres
sites, respectively. soils were sampled on 6 august 2009.
these soils had a cu content that ranged from 379 to
784 mg kg-1 dry weight soil (d.w.s). the concentrations
exceed the standard acceptable level of 40 mg kg-1 for
soil by the quebec regulatory authorities (ministere de l
environnement du quebec, 1999). a pasture soil from a
non-polluted site was sampled from the casablanca val-
ley, central chile on 5 august 2010. the non-polluted

(hamburg, germany) using the

dgge was performed using the method previously
reported [28] with minor modifications. the biorad
dcode dgge system was used with an 8% (w/v) poly-
acrylamide gel containing a denaturing gradient from
30% to 60% (100% denaturant contains 40% (v/v) forma-
mide and 7 m urea). equal amounts of dna were
loaded on each well. amplicons were separated at con-
stant voltage of 70 v for 13 h at 58c. the gel was
stained with gelred (biotium inc., hayward, ca, usa)
1:10,000 (v/v) for 30 min, digitally photographed under
uv light and analyzed in a gel doc xr system (bio-
rad, hercules, ca, usa).

bands of dgge profiles were analyzed by using the
software phoretix 1d v11.2 (non linear dynamics,
newcastle, uk). background noise was subtracted by
rolling ball algorithm with a radius of 50 pixels; the
automatic band detection was performed with a mini-
mum slope of 100 and a noise reduction of 5, and peaks
smaller than 2% of the maximum peak were discarded.
bands were manually corrected and matched to create
an absent/present binary matrix. a dendrogram was
constructed by unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic mean (upgma), clustering using percentage

site was located in la vinilla (longitude 71o2436 w and
latitude 32o1930.254 s) located 6268 km distant from
the three polluted sites. soil samples were air-dried and
sieved to 2 mm and homogenized. the soil samples were
stored in polyethylene bags and preserved in a dark
room at 4c until analyses.

soil chemical analyses
soil ph was measured using a 1:2 (w/v) a soil/deionized
water mixture. the organic matter content was deter-
mined by the dichromate oxidation [27]. for heavy metal
analyses (cu, zn, pb, cr and ni), soils were digested
with a 10:4:1 hno3/hclo4/h2so4 mixture. exchange-
able cu from soils (1 g d.w.s) was extracted with 10 ml
of mgcl2 solution (1 m, ph 7) at room temperature with
continuous agitation for 1 h. total heavy metal content
and the exchangeable cu were quantified by atomic ab-
sorption spectrometry (aas) using spectraa-800 spec-
trophotometer varian (santa clara, ca, usa).

dna extraction from soil
metagenomic dna was extracted from 0.5 g of soil in
triplicate using the fastdna spin kit for soil (mp bio-
medicals, solon, ohio, usa). cells were disrupted using
the fastprep-24 instrument
(mp biomedicals, solon,
ohio, usa) following the manufacturer's instructions.
subsequently, the dna extract was purified by gene-
clean spin kit (mp biomedicals, solon, ohio, usa).
dna was quantified using qubit fluorometer (invitro-
gen, carlsbad, ca, usa).

of similarity averages with multivariate statistical pack-
age (mvsp) version 3.13 h (geomem, blairgowrie,
united kingdom). the diversity of bacterial communi-
ties were determined by the shannon index (h) that
considers the total number of species in a bacterial com-
munity (s, richness) and the frequency of the species
(abundance). the richness of bacterial community was
determined by the number of bands present in dgge
profiles of soils [15]. three soil replicates were analyzed
for each dgge soil sample.

detection of copa gene in metagenomic dna from soils
metagenomic dna extracted from each soil was used
for copa gene amplification. the degenerated primers
forward coprun f2 (5-ggsasdtactggtrbcac-3)
(5-tgnghcatcatsg
and
trtcrtt-3) [26] were used for copa gene amplifica-
tion from soil metagenomic dna. degenerated coprun
primers were designed for the amplification of copa
genes that encode the multi-copper oxidase from proteo-
bacteria. dna amplification was performed using the
following conditions: 1 cycle of 94c for 3 min, 35 cycles
of 94c for 1 min, 58c for 1 min, 72c for 1 min, plus a
final extension at 72c for 7 min.

enumeration of heterotrophic bacteria and isolation of
cu-tolerant bacteria from soils
bacterial cells were extracted from 1 g of each soil sus-
pended in 9 ml of phosphate buffer (50 mm, ph 7) and
vigorously shaken in an orbital shaker (200 rpm) for
30 min. after decantation for 1 min, serial dilutions were
prepared from the supernatant. the total cultivable
heterotrophic bacteria were grown in r2a medium
supplemented with cycloheximide (100 mg l-1) [29]. the
cu-tolerant bacteria were grown in same conditions sup-
plemented with cu2+ (0.8 mm) [30]. ninety two bacterial
strains (29 to 31 from each polluted soil) were isolated
based on their capability to grow in presence of cu2+
(0.8 mm) and the colony morphology. statistical analysis
was performed using one-way anova (originpro 8 for
windows). differences were considered to be significant at
p  0.05.

minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cu and other
heavy metals for bacterial strains
bacterial isolates were grown in diluted (1:10) tsb li-
(10 l) of each culture
quid medium. an aliquot
grown until stationary phase were placed onto the agar
plates with low phosphate tris mineral salts (lptms)
medium [31], supplemented with cu2+ concentrations
ranged from 0.8 to 4.7 mm (in increasing concentra-
tion of 0.4 mm steps). inoculated plates were incu-
bated at 30c and checked for growth after 72 h.

able to grow in presence of cu2+ (2.8 mm). lptms
medium supplemented with different concentrations of
each heavy metal was used following a protocol previ-
ously described [31]. the concentrations of co2+ ranged
from 0.8 to 6.8 mm (in increasing concentration of
0.2 mm steps), ni2+ ranged from 0.8 to 17 mm (in in-
creasing concentration of 0.3 mm steps), zn2+ ranged
from 0.8 to 17 mm (in increasing concentration of
0.3 mm steps), cd2+ ranged from 0.4 to 3.6 mm (in in-
creasing concentration of 0.2 mm steps), hg2+ ranged
from 0.005 to 0.5 mm (in increasing concentration of
2- ranged from 0.4 to 8.6 mm
0.025 mm steps), and cro4
(in increasing concentration of 0.2 mm steps). the
plates were incubated at 30c for 72 h. the mic ana-
lyses were done in duplicate.

pcr amplification of 16s rrna and heavy metal
resistance genes from bacterial isolates
pcr reactions were conducted in a volume of 25 l
containing specific primers (0.6 m each), deoxyribo-
nucleoside triphosphate (400 m each), pcr buffer,
taq polymerase (1.25 u), mgcl2 (3 mm). genomic
dna was prepared from single colonies re-suspended
in 100 l of tris-edta buffer (te, ph 7.5), heated at
95c for 5 min and centrifuged briefly. the super-
natant (2 l) was used for pcr reactions. the univer-
sal primers forward 27f and reverse 1492r were used
for 16s rrna gene amplification. the primers forward
coprun f2 and reverse coprun r1 were used for the
amplification of the copa gene. the forward primer
5-gtcgttagcttgccaacatc-3 and the reverse
primer 5-cggaaagcaagatgtcgaatcg-3
[31]
were used for chrb gene (chromate resistance) amplifi-
cation. the forward primer 5-accatcggcggca
cctgcgt-3 and the reverse primer 5-accatcg
tcaggtaggggaacaa-3 were used for mera gene
(inorganic mercury resistance) amplification [32]. the
forward primers 5-tcgcccatatattttagaac-3
and the reverse primer 5-gtcgggacagatgcaa
agaaa-3 were used for merb gene (organic mer-
cury resistance) amplification [32]. dna amplification
of chrb, mera and merb was carried out using the
following conditions: 1 cycle of 94c for 3 min,
30 cycles of 94c for 1 min, 57c for 1 min, 72c for
1 min, plus a final extension at 72c for 7 min. c.

16s rrna and copa genes sequence analyses
the pcr products were visualized by agarose gel elec-
trophoresis. bands were cut from the gel with a scalpel
and dna was recovery using zimoclean gel dna re-
covery kit (irvine, ca, usa). the purified dna was
sequenced directly by an applied biosystem 3730xl
dna sequence (carlsbad, ca, usa), using the primers
27f and 1492r for 16s rrna gene and coprun f2 and
coprun r1 for copa gene sequencing, respectively. the
nucleotide sequences of 16s rrna genes were aligned
with sequences available in the genbank (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). the nucleotide sequence of copa
gene was translated into a protein sequence using blastx.
then, partial sequences of copa were aligned with other
copa sequences from cu-resistant bacteria [18]. a
phylogenetic analysis was performed to study the evolu-
tionary relationships of
the sequences based on the
alignments calculated by clustal w using the default
options. the evolutionary history was inferred using the
neighbor-joining method. evolutionary analyses were con-
ducted in mega 5.05 software [33]. the 16s rrna gene
sequence of strains o12, a32, a55, c21 and o4 were sub-
mitted to the embl nucleotide sequence database under
accession number embl:he608567, embl:he608568,
embl:he608569, embl:he608570 and embl:he608571,
respectively. the copa gene sequence of strains o12, a32,
a55, c21 and o4 were submitted to the embl nucleotide
sequence database under accession number embl:
he716432, embl:he716433, embl:he16434, embl:
he16435, embl:he16436, respectively.

plasmid isolation from bacterial strains
plasmid isolation from bacterial strains was performed
using the method of kado and liu [34] with minor
modifications [31]. plasmids were visualized in agar-
ose gel electrophoresis. bands were cut from the gel
with a scalpel and plasmids were recovery from the
gel using zimoclean gel dna recovery kit (irvine,
ca, usa). the presence of copa gene in plasmids
was assessed by pcr using the protocol described
above.

results
the bacterial communities of three cu-polluted agricul-
tural soils and one non-polluted soil from valparaiso re-
gion, central chile, were characterized. the three
polluted agricultural sites from aconcagua valley are
located close to an active or an abandoned cu smelter.
an agricultural soil located far away from mining activ-
ities in casablanca valley was selected as a non-polluted
site. soils from aconcagua valley (loam) and from casa-
blanca valley (sandy loam) were neutral. soils from
south chagres and nilhue showed higher organic matter
content (4.5%) than soils from north chagres and la

vinilla (2.3%). the total cu concentrations of the acon-
cagua valley soils ranged from 379 to 784 mg kg-1,
whereas the total cu concentration in the la vinilla soil
was only 21 mg kg-1. the exchangeable cu concentra-
tion of the north and south chagres soils was 2.0 and
1.9 mg kg-1, respectively, and 1.2 mg kg-1 for the nilhue
soil. the exchangeable cu concentration observed in the
la vinilla soil was below the detection limit (0.1 mg
kg-1). the total concentrations of zn (ranged from 97 to
205 mg kg-1), pb (ranged from 33 to 73 mg kg-1) and cr
(ranged from 13 to 19 mg kg-1) in cu-polluted soils
from aconcagua valley were high, whereas in la vinilla
soil heavy metals were present at low concentration.

upgma analysis of banding patterns from bacterial
dgge profiles of
sites were
grouped into four clusters (figure 2b). replicates from
each agricultural soil showed a very high similarity
(approximately 95%). soils from south chagres, nilhue
and north chagres showed a high similarity (approxi-
mately 80%). the non-polluted la vinilla soil showed a
similarity of 73% with the cu-polluted soils (figure 2b).
the values of shannon index obtained for each soil were
3.65  0.01 for north chagres, 3.77  0.01 for south cha-
gres, 3.65  0.01 for nilhue and 3.71  0.03 for la vinilla.
the richness values (s) obtained for each soil were
38.67  0.58 for north chagres, 43.67  0.58 for south
chagres, 38.33  0.58 for nilhue and 40.67  1.15 for la
vinilla (figure 2b).

pcr detection of cu-resistance genes in metagenomic
dna from agricultural soils
the presence of the copa gene in the metagenomic
dna from the four agricultural soils was studied. the
copa gene was detected by pcr in the three cu-
polluted soils from aconcagua valley (data not shown).
in contrast, the copa gene was not detected in the non-
polluted soil from casablanca valley.

copper tolerance of bacterial community
the cu-tolerance of the bacterial community of the agri-
cultural soils was determined. the cultivable heterotrophic
bacteria ranged from 1.2  107 to 2.2  107 cfu g-1 d.w.s in
cu-polluted and non-polluted soils. the cu-tolerant culti-
vable bacteria ranged from 3 to 23% (from 7.4  105 to
2.8  106 cfu g-1 d.w.s) of the total cultivable heterotrophic
bacteria in cu-polluted agricultural soils from aconcagua
valley.
the
cu-tolerant bacteria were 0.4% (5.9  104 cfu g-1 d.w.s).

isolated were challenged with successive cu2+ concen-
trations from 0.8 to 4.7 mm in lptms medium. a
marked decrease in the cells number was observed in
the medium containing cu2+ (2.8 mm). eleven bacteria
that were capable of growing in the presence of cu2+
(2.8 mm) were selected from the 92 isolates for further
studies. two bacterial strains isolated from nilhue were
capable of tolerate 3.5 mm of cu2+. three isolates from
south chagres tolerate 3.5 mm of cu2+. six strains from
north chagres were capable of tolerate 2.8 mm of cu2+.
the cu-resistant
isolates were challenged to heavy
metals for the determination of the mic values. five of
the eleven cu-resistant strains isolated (strain c21 from
north chagres,
strains a32 and a55 from south
chagres; strains o4 and o12 from nilhue) showed also
tolerance to co2+, ni2+, zn2+, hg2+ and cro4
2- (table 2).
these five broad-range heavy metal resistant bacteria
should possess diverse mechanisms for heavy metal re-
sistance. therefore, these isolates were selected for fur-

analysis of 16s rrna gene profiles of bacterial communities from the
four agricultural soils. gel image analysis was performed by using
phoretix 1d software package. bands were automatically detected
and manually corrected. a binary matrix was generated by presence
or absence bands. the sample similarities were analyzed by mvsp.

the number of cu-tolerant cultivable bacteria was signifi-
cantly larger in cu-polluted soils than in non-polluted soil
(p  0.05). the highest frequency of cu-tolerant bacteria
was found in the cu-polluted soil of south chagres, which
is the soil with the highest cu content, while the lowest rate
was found in the non-polluted soil from la vinilla. these
results revealed that cu-tolerant cultivable bacteria in cu-
polluted soils were approximately 13 to 46 fold higher than
in the non-polluted soil (table 1).

characterization of cu-resistant bacterial isolates
cu-resistant bacteria were isolated from the three cu-
polluted soils from the aconcagua valley. a representa-
tive collection of 92 bacterial strains (29 to 31 from each
cu-polluted soil) were isolated by enrichment in r2a
medium containing cu2+ (0.8 mm). the soil bacteria

identification of cu-resistant isolates
for bacterial identification, comparative 16s rrna gene
sequence analyses of the bacterial
isolates were used.
the results indicated that isolates o12, a32 and a55 be-
long to the sphingomonas genus, showing a high 16s
rrna gene sequence similarity (98%) to sphingomonas
paucimobilis. isolate c21 was identified as a stenotro-
phomonas
showing a high 16s rrna gene
sequence similarity (98%) to stenotrophomonas malto-
philia. isolate o4 was identified as an arthrobacter
strain, with high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity
(99%) to arthrobacter oxydans. the 16s rrna gene
sequences of the isolates and other bacteria including
strains
and
arthrobacter genera were used to build a phylogenetic
tree (figure 3). strains o12, a32 and a55 are closely
related to sphingomonas paucimobilis strain os-64.a.
strain c21 is closely related with stenotrophomonas
maltophilia strains hr69 and d109. strain o4 is closely
related with the gram-positive bacteria arthrobacter
oxydans wa4-3 and arthrobacter oxydans ea6-10
(figure 3).

pcr detection of heavy metal determinants in genomic
dna from bacterial isolates
the presence of the copa gene encoding a multi-copper
oxidase in the bacterial isolates was studied by pcr using
the coprun primers. the bacterial strains o12, a32, a55,
c21 and o4 possess the copa genes. the pcr products
varied between 10001200 bp. the copa protein
sequences were aligned with copa sequences belonging to
cu-resistant bacteria and were used to construct a phylo-
genetic tree (figure 4). sequence analyses indicate that the
copa genes of the isolates encode multi-copper oxidases
that are involved in cu resistance but that are not asso-
ciated to degradation of phenolic compounds or polymers.
the copa protein of sphingomonas sp. strains o12, a32
and a55 are closely related to copa of other -proteobac-
teria, sharing high similarity (93%) with copa from sphin-
gomonas sp. s17. the copa from stenotrophomonas sp.
strain c21 belongs to the stenotrophomonas and xantho-
monas copa branch of the -proteobacteria and is closely
related to copa from stenotrophomonas maltophilia r551-
3 (67% similarity). the copa of strain arthrobacter sp. o4
is closely related to the copa of actinobacteria and possess
a 68% similarity with copa from arthrobacter sp. strain
fb24.

discussion
in this report, the bacterial communities in long-term
cu-polluted agricultural soils from aconcagua valley,
central chile, were studied and compared with the bac-
terial community of a non-polluted agricultural soil. the
bacterial dgge profiles showed high similarity (approxi-
mately 80%) among cu-contaminated soils suggesting a
low variation in the dominant bacterial groups in these
soils. a similar number of bands and banding pattern
was observed by dgge fingerprints in polluted and
non-polluted soils. despite of the difference in the cu
content in soils, dgge studies presented a similar shan-
non diversity index (h) and richness suggesting that the
presence of high copper concentration and differences
in other soil properties did not affect the diversity of the
dominant groups of the bacterial communities detected
by dgge. these results are in agreement with a previ-
ous report of soils from abandoned cu mines from
south australia that show a low impact of cu on the
dominant microbial diversity [35]. probably, bacterial
communities from long-term cu-polluted soils are well
adapted to the high cu content. short-term cu pollution
in soil
induces significant modifications in bacterial
community structure, but these changes were resilient
after a few weeks or months [9]. our results are in
agreement with previous studies showing that cu, pb
and zn did not change significantly the bacterial diver-
sity after long-term contamination [36,37].

the copa gene that encodes for the multi-copper oxi-
dase is one of the main genetic determinants involved in
cu-resistance [1,25,26]. in this report, the presence of
copa gene was studied in metagenomic dna from agri-
cultural soils. the copa gene was detected in the three
cu-polluted soils. in contrast, the copa gene was not
detected in metagenomic dna from soils with low
cu content. the number of heterotrophic cultivable bac-
teria was constant in all agricultural soils, whereas, the
number of cu-resistant heterotrophic bacteria was sig-
nificantly higher in cu-polluted soils than in the non-

polluted soil. these results suggest that the presence of
high levels of cu in aconcagua valley soils is exerting a
selective pressure on the bacterial communities, which
favors the selection of cu-tolerant bacteria.

cu-tolerant bacteria were isolated from the cu-
isolates
polluted agricultural soils. most of bacterial
were not capable to grow in lptms medium sup-
plemented with cu2+ (2 mm). our results are con-
sistent with a previous study that indicates that the
number of resistant bacteria decreased at higher cu2+

concentration [38]. five isolates, sphingomonas sp. strain
o12, sphingomonas sp. strain a32, sphingomonas sp.
strain a55, stenotrophomonas sp. strain c21 and arthro-
bacter sp. strain o4, were resistant to high cu2+ concen-
tration ( 2.8 mm) and other heavy metals. bacteria that
tolerate cu concentrations higher than 2 mm should
possess an effective resistance system for cu detoxifica-
tion. the isolates sphingomonas sp. strain o12, sphingo-
monas sp. strain a32 and sphingomonas sp. strain a55,

6.0, 17 and 0.1 mm, respectively. stenotrophomonas sp.

mic to cu2+ (ranged from 3.1 to 3.9 mm) and cro4

2- of 0.7 mm. these high levels of heavy metal resis-
cro4
tances may be useful for surviving and adapting to acute
heavy metal contamination events in the soil. the

mechanisms involved in heavy metal resistance of the
strains isolated should be studied. sphingomonas macro-
goltabidus
strain s1n isolated from rhizosphere of
alyssum murale, showed a high mic to cu2+ (5 mm)
and ni2+ (15 mm) [38]. stenotrophomonas maltophilia

showed high mic to cu2+ (5 mm), ni2+ (10 mm), zn2+
(4 mm), and hg2+ (0.05 mm) [39]. arthrobacter sp.
strain e9 isolated from a battery-manufacturing con-
taminated site, showed a high mic to cu2+ (5.8 mm),
co2+ (2.5 mm), zn2+ (3 mm) and hg2+ (0.06 mm) [40].

stenotrophomonas strain (c21) and arthrobacter strain
(o4) are closely related to copa from sphingomonas,
stenotrophomonas and arthrobacter strains, respectively.
the copa genes of the fives isolates encode multi-copper
oxidases that oxidize cu(i) to cu(ii) but not phenolic
compounds or polymers as other multi-copper oxidases
reported [41,42].

phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences in-
dicate that the isolates belong to sphingomonas, steno-
trophomonas and arthrobacter genera. the phylogenetic
tree obtained from the sequence analysis of 16s rrna
gene was similar to those results predicted from the se-
quence analysis of copa protein (figure 3 and 4), show-
ing

arthrobacter sp. strain s189 isolated from rhizosphere
showed a high mic to cu2+
of alyssum murale,
(10 mm), co2+ (5 mm), ni2+ (15 mm), zn2+ (10 mm)
and hg2+ (0.5 mm) [38].

the high level of heavy metal resistance of sphingomo-
nas sp. strain o12, sphingomonas sp. strain a32, sphin-
gomonas sp. strain a55, stenotrophomonas sp. strain
c21 and arthrobacter sp. strain o4 suggests that these
strains possess diverse heavy metal determinants. the
use of specific primers based on heavy metal determi-
nants from c. metallidurans strain msr33 did not yield
amplicons. in future studies, the presence of heavy metal
resistance genes will be studied using more general
primers.

in this study, the presence of multi-copper oxidase
gene was evaluated in the five isolates using degenerated
primers designed for copa sequences from proteobac-
teria. the presence of multi-copper oxidase copa genes
in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria was
determined. the presence of copa gene in both bacterial
groups suggests that the cop system involved in cu-
resistance could be widespread in soil probably through
horizontal genes transfer among soil bacteria. the se-
quence analysis indicates that the copa proteins from
sphingomonas
and a55),

(o12, a32

isolates

therefore,

they become

mobile genetic elements (mge) could be involved in
the spreading of cu resistance determinants, facilitating
the adaptation of bacterial communities to copper [43].
bacteria exposed to copper for a long period of time
may acquire mge such as plasmids carrying copper
determinants and,
copper-
resistant bacteria [43-45]. in agreement with this hy-
pothesis, this study showed the presence of the copa
gene in metagenomic dna from the three cu-polluted
soils and the absence of copa gene in metagenomic
dna from the non-polluted soil. this study demon-
strates that gram-negative cu-resistant strains isolated
from long-term cu-contaminated soils carried plasmid
with cu-resistance determinants. the presence of plas-
mids encoding copa genes in sphingomonas sp. strain
o12, sphingomonas sp. strain a32, sphingomonas sp.
strain a55 and stenotrophomonas sp. c21 (figure 5)
confirm that mge are involved in copper resistance in
these isolates. the copa (pcoa) genes encoding multi-
copper oxidases have been characterized in plasmids
such as ppt23d, prj1004 and pmol30 from escheri-
chia coli rj92, pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato pt23
and cupriavidus metallidurans ch34,
respectively
[20,21,24]. the multi-copper oxidase copa gene was
present in the genome of the gram-positive bacterium
arthrobacter sp. o4, but plasmids were not detected in
this strain. the copa protein sequence from arthrobac-
ter sp. o4 possesses a high similarity (68%) with the
multi-copper oxidase gene of arthrobacter sp. fb24,
which is located in a plasmid [46,47]. as plasmid isola-
tion in some bacterial strains is difficult, the presence of
the copa gene from arthrobacter sp. o4 in a plasmid
could not be excluded.

conclusions
this study have shown that the bacterial community di-
versity of agricultural soil of central chile analyzed by
dgge was similar in cu-polluted and non-polluted
soils. the copa gene encoding multi-copper oxidase was

detected only in metagenomic dna of cu-polluted soils
suggesting that copa genes are widely spread in con-
taminated environments. cu-resistant bacteria were iso-
lated from these long-term polluted soils. the mic
studies on bacterial isolates indicated that cu-resistant
bacteria were also resistant to other heavy metal such as
2-. the copa gene was detected in
ni2+, hg2+ and cro4
the cu-resistant sphingomonas, stenotrophomonas and
arthrobacter strains isolated from the polluted agricul-
tural soils. the multi-copper oxidase copa gene is
located in plasmids in the four sphingomonas and steno-
trophomonas strains suggesting that mges may spread
cu-resistance determinants in these soils. this study
contributes to the understanding of the effect of long-
term cu-pollution on the bacterial community of
agricultural soils and to the characterization of novel
cu-resistant bacterial
isolates from agricultural soils
from the aconcagua valley.
