abstract

background:genome characterization of the model pcb-degrading bacterium burkholderia xenovorans lb400 revealed the
presence of eleven central pathways for aromatic compounds degradation, among them, the homogentisate and the
homoprotocatechuate pathways. however, the functionality of these central pathways in strain lb400 has not been
assessed and related peripheral pathways has not been described.

methodology/principalfindings: the aims of this study were to determine the functionality of the homogentisate and
homoprotocatechuate central pathways in b. xenovorans lb400 and to establish their role in 3-hydroxyphenylacetate (3-
hpa) and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4-hpa) catabolism. strain lb400 was able to grow using 3-hpa and 4-hpa as sole carbon
source. a genomic search in lb400 suggested the presence of mhaab and hpabc genes clusters encoding proteins of the 3-
hydroxyphenylacetate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate peripheral pathways. lb400 cells grown with 3-hpa and 4-hpa
degraded homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate and showed homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase and homoprotocatech-
uate 2,3-dioxygenase activities. transcriptional analyses by rt-pcr showed the expression of two chromosomally-encoded
homogentisate dioxygenases (bxea2725 and bxea3900) and the hpad gene encoding the homoprotocatechuate 2,3-
dioxygenase during 3-hpa and 4-hpa degradation. the proteome analyses by two-dimensional polyacrilamide gel
electrophoresis of b. xenovorans lb400 grown in 3-hpa and 4-hpa showed the induction of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase
hmgb (bxea3899).

conclusions/significance:this study revealed that strain lb400 used both homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate ring-
cleavage pathways for 3- hydroxyphenylacetate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate catabolism and that these four catabolic
routes are functional, confirming the metabolic versatility of b. xenovorans lb400.

introduction

that

funnel

aromatic compounds are widely distributed in ecosystems
mainly released from plant materials and by anthropogenic
activities. bacteria have evolved to metabolize diverse aromatic
compounds
including environmental pollutants, using these
compounds as carbon and energy source. a broad range of
aromatic compounds is degraded by bacteria through peripheral
pathways
in
peripheral pathways, activation of the aromatic ring is commonly
mediated by monooxygenases or dioxygenases
that produce
dihydroxylated intermediates. central pathways involve the fission
by a dioxygenase of
the dihydroxylated aromatic metabolic
intermediates at ortho- or meta-position and lead to the formation
of krebs cycle intermediates [14]. bacterial metabolism of
aromatic compounds has been extensively studied [311]. the
metabolic reconstruction of aromatic compounds pathways in in

into few central pathways

[13].

model environmental bacteria has been achieved by genome
sequence analyses [3,1214]. however, further studies are needed
to establish gene function and to elucidate functional aromatic
metabolic pathways of bacteria.

b. xenovorans lb400 is a model bacterium for the degradation
of pcbs and other aromatic compounds [3,15,16]. strain lb400
has one of the largest bacterial genomes (9.73 mbp), distributed
in a major chromosome (c1), a minor chromosome (c2) and a
megaplasmid (mp). genome analyses of strain lb400 revealed the
presence of genes encoding eleven central pathways and twenty
peripheral pathways for aromatic compounds degradation [3]. the
genes encoding the homogentisate and the homoprotocatechuate
central pathways were identified in b. xenovorans lb400 genome [3].
the hmgabc and hpagedfhi gene clusters are located at c1 and
c2, respectively. additional hmg gene copies were identified within
lb400 genome [3]. both ring-cleavage pathways are used in
aromatic amino acid metabolism in bacteria and eucarya [1720].

the homogentisate pathway has been described as the central route
for the degradation of l-tyrosine and l-phenylalanine in bacteria,
fungi and mammals
[19,21,22]. the homogentisate central
pathway is encoded by the hmgabc operon in pseudomonas putida
strain u [19]. homogentisate (hmg) cleavage is catalysed by the
hmg 1,2-dioxygenase hmga producing maleylacetoacetate (ma).
ma is isomerized by a maleylacetoacetate isomerase (hmgc) into
fumarylacetoacetate, which is further converted by a fumarylace-
toacetate hydrolase (hmgb) into fumarate and acetoacetate [23].
the homoprotocatechuate pathway has been described as a central
route for the catabolism of aromatic amino acids and related
compounds in klebsiella pneumoniae, p. putida, and escherichia coli
[2,2428]. the homoprotocatechuate pathway is encoded by the
hpagedfhi gene cluster in e. coli strain w. homoprotocatechuate
(hpc) is meta-cleaved by a hpc 2,3-dioxygenase encoded by the
hpad gene. the product 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic
semialdehyde (chms) is then converted to 5-carboxymethyl-2-
hydroxy-muconic acid (chm) and subsequently degraded by the
hpaf, hpag, hpah and hpai gene products
into krebs cycle
intermediates [2,17,18,28].

degradation of phenylacetate hydroxylated-derivatives is chan-
neled into the hmg or the hpc central pathways [17,20,29,30].
assimilation of 3-hydroxyphenylacetate (3-hpa)
through the
homogentisate pathway in p. putida u has been reported. the
mhaab genes encode a 3-hpa 6-hydroxylase that hydroxylates 3-
hpa at c-6 producing hmg [19,30]. in addition, p. putida strain
u degrades 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4-hpa) via the homoproto-
catechuate pathway [27]. e. coli strains w, b and c are able to
degrade both 3-hpa and 4-hpa via the homoprotocatechuate
central route, which is encoded by the inducible hpagedfhi
operon [2,18,24,26]. the hpabc gene cluster encodes a 4-hpa 3-
hydroxylase involved in the hydroxylation of 4-hpa and 3-hpa
to yield hpc [18]. the hpabc and hpagedfhi gene clusters
constitute a single operon in e. coli strain w [2,18].

the aims of this study were to determine functional homo-
in b.
gentisate and homoprotocatechuate central pathways
xenovorans strain lb400 and to establish their role in 3-hpa and
4-hpa peripheral pathways, which has not been described
previously in this bacterium. this
study showed that both
homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate central pathways are
involved in 3-hpa and 4-hpa degradation in strain lb400.

materials and methods

chemicals

3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (.99% purity), 4-hydroxyphenyla-
cetic acid (98% purity) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
(homoprotocatechuate; 98% purity) and 2,5-dihydroxyphenylace-
tic acid (homogentisate; 98% purity) were obtained from sigma-
aldrich (saint louis, mo, usa).

bacterial strain and culture conditions

burkholderia xenovorans lb400 was cultivated at 30uc in mineral
m9 medium with trace solution and glucose (5 mm) [31], 3-hpa
(5 mm) or 4-hpa (5 mm) as the sole carbon and energy source.
growth was determined by measuring turbidity at 525 nm and by
counting colony-forming units (cfu). aliquots taken from cultures
were diluted and plated on luria-bertani agar medium. cfu per
milliliter values were calculated as the mean 6 sd of at least three
independent experiments.

hydroxyphenylacetates catabolism by b. xenovorans

30uc. aliquots of cell suspensions were taken at different incubation
times and centrifuged (19,283 g for 2 min). assays with boiled cells
and without cells were used as controls. cell-free supernatants were
analyzed, using a waters
liquid chromatograph model 515
equipped with a uv detector and a rp-c18/lichrospher 5-mm
column (supelco, bellefonte, usa). the mobile phase contained
20% acetonitrile, 20% methanol, 60% water and 0.1% phosphoric
acid. the flow rate was 0.5 ml min-1. hmg and hpc had
retention times of 4.6 and 5.1 min, respectively. hmg and hpc
were quantified using calibration curves with authentic standards.
resting cells experiments were performed in triplicate.

preparation of cell extracts

cells harvested at exponential phase of growth (turbidity525 nm =
0.400.45) were centrifuged (10,733 g for 10 min) at 4uc and
washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0). bacterial
cells were disrupted using an ultrasonic cell disruptor microsontm
at 4uc. lysate was clarified by centrifugation (19,300 g for 15 min)
at 4uc. protein concentration was determined using qubittm
fluorometer (invitrogen).

dioxygenase activity assays

hmg dioxygenase activity was determined spectrophotometri-
cally by measuring the formation of ma at 330 nm as previously
described [32]. the assay volume (1 ml) contained: 50 mm
phosphate buffer (ph 7.0), 50 mm feso4, 2 mm ascorbate, crude
extract (100 mg of protein) and 0.3 mm hmg. the reactions were
carried out at 30uc and initiated by the addition of hmg. one
enzyme milliunit corresponds to the transformation of 1 mmol of
hmg to ma per min at 30uc under the conditions described
above. hmg dioxygenase activity was calculated using the molar
extinction coefficient of ma, 13,500 m21 cm21 [33]. hpc
dioxygenase activity was measured by monitoring the formation
of 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde (chms) at
380 nm [34]. lb400 cells cultivated using 3-hpa, 4-hpa or
glucose were harvested at a turbidity525 nm of 0.45, washed and
concentrated. hpc dioxygenase activity of lb400 cell suspension
(turbidity525 nm = 2.0) was determined by incubation with 0.3 mm
hpc at 30uc. at intervals, the a380nm values of supernatants were
measured.

two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(2-de)

2-de gels with non-equilibrium ph gradient electrophoresis
(ph 310) were performed as previously described [31,35]. cell
cultures were grown using glucose, 3-hpa or 4-hpa (5 mm) as
sole carbon source. cells were harvested at exponential phase
(turbidity525nm = 0.400.45) by centrifugation, disrupted with a
sonicator and concentrated in a speed-vac concentrator. dried
samples were resuspended in lysis buffer (9.5 m urea, 2% v/v
igepal ca-630, 2% ampholytes (1.6% ampholytes ph 57,
0.4% ampholytes ph 310, bio-rad) and 5% b-mercaptoethanol.
nephge gels were electrophoresed for 6.5 h at 400 v. the
second dimension was performed in 11% polyacrilamide-sds
gels. proteins were visualized with coomassie brilliant blue r-250.
the volume (int 6mm2) of the spots was analyzed, using quantity
one image analysis software (bio-rad laboratories). to stan-
dardize the quantification of independent experiments, the ratio of
the intensity of the protein to a reference protein was calculated.

resting cell assays

protein sequencing and identification

resting cells (turbidity 525nm = 2.0) in 50 mm sodium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.0) were incubated with hmg or hpc (0.03 mm) at

to perform the mass spectrometric analysis, protein spots
were recovered from gels and prepared as described [31]. for

matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-
tof) analysis, the peptide extracts were analysed with a maldi-
tof ultraxex apparatus
(bruker, bremen, germany). the
peptide fingerprints obtained by mass spectrometry maldi-
tof were used for searches in the ncbi protein database with
the matrix science mascot search tool. the complete
sequences of each protein were obtained and blast searches
were executed with the fasta tool for the identification and
similarity data analyses.

isolation of total rna and rt-pcr

total rna was isolated from lb400 cells in the stationary
growth phase using an rneasy mini kit
(qiagen, hilden,
germany) according to the manufacturers recommendations.
dnase i treatment was carried out using the rnase-free dnase
set (qiagen, hilden, germany) to degrade any residual dna. the
rna concentration was quantified using a qubittm fluorometer
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). reverse transcription-pcr
(rt-pcr) was carried out with sequence-specific primers design
in this study for hmga1 (bxea2725), hmga2 (bxea3900) and hpad
(bxeb2031) genes by using superscripttm one-step rt-pcr
with platinumhtaq (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). the bxea2725
gene (hmga1) was amplified using the primers hmga1-f (59-att-
tgcgaccgaaacgctgcc-39) and hmga1-r (59-cgacg-
ggttgaagtgcttcc-39). amplification of the bxea3900 gene
(hmga2) was performed with specific primers hmga2-f (59-tac-
gccgaacactgtcagttcg-39) and hmga2-r (59-gccc-
cgaaattctcgcagatgta-39). reverse transcriptase reaction
for hpad mrna was performed using the primers hpad-f (59-
ctcgcgttggcagcaaaagtg-39) and hpad-r (59-gca-
gaggcgtaaccggaaag-39). amplification of the 16s rrna
gene was used as control for dna contamination using the primers
(59-

analysis of hmg and hpa gene clusters in strain lb400

the

cluster

hmgabc gene

(bxea2725; bxea2724 and
bxea2723; hereafter hmga1, hmgb1 and hmgc1, respectively)
is
located at c1 of strain lb400 genome. copies of the hmga1 gene

hydroxyphenylacetates catabolism by b. xenovorans

and hmgb1 genes (bxea3900 and bxea3899, respectively) were
identified in a 1,300 kb distant region from hmga1b1c1 cluster at
c1 (hereafter hmga2 and hmgb2). a hmgc gene copy (bxea4141;
hereafter hmgc2) is located in a different region of c1 [3] (fig. 1a).
sequence analyses of
the chromosomal region flanking the
hmga1b1c1 gene cluster in the strain lb400, revealed that the
products of
the open reading frames (orfs) bxea2727 and
bxea2726 shared 47% and 35% sequences identity with the
mhaa and mhab proteins from p. putida strain u, respectively
[30] (fig. 1a). in p. putida u the enzyme 3-hpa 6-hydroxylase
(mhaab) is a two- component fad-dependent monooxygenase
that hydroxylates 3-hpa to produce hmg (fig. 2). the large
component mhaa is a flavoprotein and the small component
mhab is a coupling protein [30]. in this study, the presence of the
mhaab genes located adjacent of hmga1b1c1 gene cluster in lb400
was revealed,
in 3-hpa
peripheral reaction leading to hmg.

suggesting a role of mhaab genes

the gene cluster hpag1g2edfhi encoding the homoprotoca-
techuate pathway is located at c2 in strain lb400 genome
(bxeb2028, bxeb2029, bxeb2030, bxeb2031, bxeb2032,
bxeb2033 and bxeb2034) (fig. 1b). downstream and adjacent
to the hpa gene cluster, a divergent gene putatively encoding the
hpar repressor protein of
the hpc catabolic pathway was
identified (fig. 1b) [3]. genes encoding the 4-hpa catabolic
pathway were not found in the neighborhood of hpa gene cluster in
strain lb400. the degradation of 4-hpa in e. coli strain w
involves enzymes encoded in the 4-hpa hydroxylase hpabc
operon and the meta-cleavage operon hpagedfhi [18]. the hpabc
cluster of strain w encodes a two-component protein responsible
for 4-hpa hydroxylation to yield hpc [18,29]. the bxeb2309
gene product of strain lb400 was identified as the 4-hpa 3-
monooxygenase coupling protein hpac located downstream to
the hpa cluster (at 309 kb). the protein encoded by the bxeb2308
gene is highly related to the hpab proteins from b. cenocepacia
strain hi2424 and r. jostii rha1 (fig. 2). based on its relatedness
with fad-dependent monooxygenases and its location next to a
putative hpac gene, the gene bxeb2308 may encode the main
component of
the closely related 4-hpa 3-monooxygenase
(hpab). however, further analyses are required to establish the
4-hpa 3-monooxygenase peripheral pathway
encoded by
bxeb2308 and bxeb2309 genes in lb400. the presence of genes

4-hpa as sole carbon source was studied. strain lb400 was able
to grow using 3-hpa and 4-hpa as sole carbon and energy source
reaching a high biomass (data not shown). strain lb400 attained
at stationary phase (25 h), slightly higher biomass using 4-hpa
(3.216fu 107 ml21) than using 3-hpa (1.28 16cfu 107 ml21)
and glucose (2.096 cfu 107 ml21) as sole carbon source. the
growth on hpas indicate that strain lb400 possess functional 3-
hpa and 4-hpa catabolic pathways.

hmg and hpc degradation by strain lb400

in order to determine the functionality of the homogentisate
and homoprotocatechuate central pathways, the degradation of
these compounds was analysed. hmg and hpc degradation by
strain lb400 were studied using resting cell assays. lb400 cells
grown either in 3-hpa or 4-hpa were able to degrade hmg and
hpc compounds. cells grown in 3-hpa and 4-hpa degraded
after 10 h of incubation 100% and .95% of hmg, respectively
(fig. 3a). it is worth noting that, during hmg degradation assays,
a brown colored medium was only observed in control assays with
boiled cells. in contrast, no pigmented medium was observed in
assays with metabolically active cells. the brown pigmentation of
the medium has been reported in bacteria and fungi that lack the
homogentisate pathway, and thus hmg accumulation and its
chemical oxidation were observed [19,20,37]. lb400 cells grown
in 3-hpa and 4-hpa degraded after 22 h almost completely hpc
(fig. 3b). a slightly faster degradation of hpc was observed with
3-hpa-grown cells than with 4-hpa-grown cells. these results
showed that strain lb400 degraded hmg and hpc,
indica-
ting that the corresponding ring-cleavage pathways are active in
3-hpa- and 4-hpa-grown cells and are involved in their
degradation.

hmg and hpc ring-cleavage activities

to further determine functional homogentisate and homo-
protocatechuate central pathways,
the enzymatic activities of
hmg dioxygenase and hpc dioxygenase were determined.
hmg dioxygenase activity was measured in crude extracts of
lb400 cells cultured in 3-hpa, 4-hpa and glucose. a high hmg
dioxygenase activity was observed during growth on 3-hpa
(82 mu/mg protein) and 4-hpa (75 mu/mg protein) (fig. 4a).
hmg dioxygenase activity was slightly higher on 3-hpa-grown
cells than on 4-hpa-grown cells, whereas no activity was observed
in glucose-grown cells. hpc dioxygenase activity was measured by
monitoring the formation of chms after whole cells incubation
with hpc. cells grown on 3-hpa and 4-hpa showed high hpc
dioxygenase activity. a moderately higher hpc dioxygenase
activity was observed in 4-hpa-grown cells than in 3-hpa-grown
cells. in contrast, a low hpc dioxygenase activity was measured in
glucose grown cells (fig. 4b). these results indicate an induction of
the key enzymes of the homogentisate and homprotocatechuate
central pathways during growth of strain lb400 on 3-hpa and
4-hpa.

hmga and hpad expression analyses by rt-pcr

further analyses were conducted in order to determine the role
of the homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate pathways in 3-
hpa and 4-hpa catabolism. the expression of hmga and hpad
genes encoding the key enzymes hmg and hpc dioxygenases
was analyzed during exponential growth of strain lb400 in 3-
hpa and 4-hpa. additionally, transcriptional analyses of two
gene copies encoding hmg 1,2-dioxygenase were performed
using specific primers for hmga1 and hmga2 genes. expression of
the hmga1 gene was observed at early exponential growth phase of
strain lb400 in 3-hpa, whereas no expression was detected

4-hpa and glucose grown-cells. these data also suggests lower

from burkholderia phytofirmans psjn. the induction of hmgb during
growth on 3-hpa, was 3.5-fold compared to glucose-grown cells.
during growth on 4-hpa, induction of this protein was 2.5-fold
compared to cells grown on glucose. the corresponding hmgb2
gene (bxea3899) is adjacent to hmga2 in strain lb400 genome.
this result correlates with the expression of hmga2 gene observed
under the same growth conditions by rt-pcr. the induction of
an enzyme belonging to the homogentisate ring-cleavage pathway
is in accordance with the degradation of hmg and the increased
hmg dioxygenase activity in strain lb400 during growth in 3-
hpa and 4-hpa. inducible expression of two enzymes from the
homogentisate pathway observed during growth of strain lb400
in hpas indicate that this catabolic pathway is involved in 3-hpa
and 4-hpa degradation by strain lb400. the lower synthesis of
hmgb protein in b. xenovorans lb400 grown in glucose indicates a
basal expression of the catabolic hmgb1 gene during growth on this

revealed the induction of an enzyme from the homogentisate
central pathway during growth of strain lb400 in 3-hpa and 4-

discussion

this

study has

shown that

the homogentisate and the
homoprotocatechuate central pathways are involved in 3-hpa
and 4-hpa catabolism by b. xenovorans strain lb400. 3-hpa and 4-
hpa isomers are used by b. xenovorans lb400 as sole carbon and
energy source for growth, indicating active peripheral and central
catabolic pathways. bacterial catabolism of hydroxyphenylacetates,
particularly 3-hpa and 4-hpa compounds have been described to
channel either the homogentisate or the homoprotocatechuate
central pathways. interestingly, this report showed that lb400
growth on 3-hpa and 4-hpa separately funnels into both central
in p. putida strain u, different catabolic
pathways. similarly,
pathways were reported for 4-hpa and 3-hpa degradation. it is
worth noting that strain lb400 showed a faster growth in 3-hpa
(5 mm) than p. putida strain u in 3-hpa (10 mm) [30]. in this
study, strain lb400 reached high biomass using 4-hpa as sole
carbon source (turbidity525 nm of 1.1) (data not shown). in contrast,
in similar media with 4-hpa as carbon source p. putida u attains
lower biomass (turbidity540 nm of 0.3) [27]. the mhaab protein
from strain u is highly specific for 3-hpa substrate to yield hmg
[30], which is further degraded by the hmgabc gene products
[19,30]. interestingly, upstream to the hmga1b1c1 cluster in the
lb400 genome, two orfs (bxea2727 and bxea2726) with high
identity to the mhaab genes from strain u were found. the mhaa
flavoprotein component (566 aa) and the mhab coupling protein
(60 aa) possess a similar length to the aminoacid sequence deduced
from bxea2727 (560 aa) and bxea2726 (60 aa) genes of strain
lb400. in a previous study, the bxea2727 was annotated as a
putative 3-(3-hydroxy-phenyl)propionate hydroxylase (mhpa) [3].
we propose that bxea2727 and bxea2726 of strain lb400 encode
the two components of the hydroxylating enzyme mhaab that is
involved in catabolism of 3-hpa via hmg (fig. 7a). however,
further analyses are required to confirm the involvement of the
mhaab genes in 3-hpa degradation by strain lb400.

alternatively, 4-hpa degradation in p. putida strain u is
mediated by a 4-hpa 3-hydroxylase yielding hpc [27].
interestingly, the results presented above indicate that both 4-
hpa and 3-hpa compounds are degraded via hpc in strain
lb400. however, based on hmga and hpad gene expression
analyses and hmg and hpc dioxygenase activities, we postulate
that 3-hpa in strain lb400 is preferentially channelled into the
homogentisate central pathway. a previous report of 4-hpa
catabolism showed that 4-hpa 3-hydroxylase from e. coli strain w
hydroxylates 4-hpa and also 3-hpa yielding hpc [29]. a search
of hpab and hpac genes in lb400 genome showed a gene
(bxeb2309) with high identity to the hpac gene encoding the 4-
hpa 3-hydroxylase coupling protein of e. coli strain w located
309 b distant from the hpagedfhi gene cluster in strain lb400.
the adjacent gene (bxeb2308) probably encodes a fad-
dependent monooxygenase distantly related to the hpab hydrox-
ylase component
the
bxeb2308 and bxeb2309 genes encode the two components of a
hydroxylase involved in 3-hpa and 4-hpa catabolism (fig. 7b).
additionally, this study demonstrated that both chromosomally
encoded homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate central path-
ways are functional in strain lb400. resting cell assays indicated
that
strain lb400 degraded hmg and hpc compounds.
moreover, a high hmg dioxygenase activity was measured in
3-hpa and 4-hpa-grown cells (82 and 75 mu/mg of protein,
respectively), whereas no activity was detected in glucose-grown
cells (fig. 4a). a similar hmg dioxygenase activity (68 mu/mg of
protein) was previously reported in crude extracts of p. putida u
cells grown on tyrosine or phenylalanine [19]. lb400 cells grown

from e. coli w [29]. we propose that

hydroxyphenylacetates catabolism by b. xenovorans

on 3-hpa and 4-hpa showed high hpc dioxygenase activities,
whereas a lower activity was measured in glucose-grown cells
(fig. 4b). these results
i) key ring-cleavage
dioxygenases of the homogentisate and the homoprotocatechuate
pathways are functional, and ii)
the homogentisate and the
homoprotocatechuate central pathways are induced in strain
lb400 during growth on 3-hpa and 4-hpa.

indicate that:

during growth of strain lb400 on 3-hpa, expression of the
hmga1 gene (bxea2725) and hmga2 gene (bxea3900) were
observed by rt-pcr. the hmga1 gene is part of the hmgabc
gene cluster in lb400, whereas the hmga2 gene is clustered only
with hmgb2 gene. in contrast, during 4-hpa degradation, the
expression of hmga2 gene but not of hmga1 gene was observed. the
results indicate that: i) the hmga1b1c1 cluster of strain lb400 is up
regulated during 3-hpa metabolism but not during 4-hpa
metabolism and, ii), two hmga gene copies are transcribed during
growth on 3-hpa. it is worth noting that these two genes have not
identical dna sequence. it is likely that one of the hmga genes was
acquired via horizontal gene transfer, which has been an
important source of genes in strain lb400 [8]. these data
indicates that growth on 3-hpa and 4-hpa are mediated by
different cellular enzymatic components. during degradation of 3-
hpa, it is likely that two hmga gene copies are used, suggesting
that enhanced catabolic abilities are required. probably,
the
homogentisate pathway in strain lb400 is regulated at the level of
hmg dioxygenase to prevent accumulation of catabolic interme-
diates that may have toxic effects on the cell. expression of two
gene copies encoding key enzymes may enhance catabolic
machinery of strain lb400. the presence of multiples hmg gene
copies spread in lb400 genome probably enhance its catabolic
capabilities. the hmgab arrangement, not linked with hmgc gene
has also been observed in silicibacter pomeroyi, pseudomonas syringae,
ralstonia solanacearum, bordetella bronchiseptica and cupriavidus necator
[7,19]. the use of the homogentisate pathway encoded by the
hmgab gene cluster has also proposed during growth on 3-hpa
and 4-hpa in c. necator
strain the
homoprotocatechuate pathway is absent [7]. the presence of
multiples genes copies encoding chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase in
c. necator
jmp134 are required for efficient chlorocatechol
degradation during growth of strain jmp134 on 3-chlorobenzoate
[38]. enhanced degradation avoids accumulation of
toxic
metabolic intermediates such as catechols [5,39]. the toxicity of
aromatic compounds and their metabolic intermediates for strain
lb400 has been reported [9,31,35].

strain jmp134;

in this

in addition to the expression of hmga genes, the hpad gene
encoding hpc dioxygenase was expressed in lb400 during
growth on 3-hpa and 4-hpa. a lower hpad expression on glucose
was observed. this in accordance with high hpc dioxygenase
observed during growth in 3-hpa and 4-hpa and a lower activity
observed in glucose-grown cells. in gammaproteobacteria, 4-hpa is
commonly degraded through the homoprotocatechuate pathway.
4-hpa degradation via hpc has been studied in some e. coli
strains such as strain w that lacks the homogentisate pathway
[2,18,29]. as mentioned above, the 4-hpa hydroxylase from e.
coli strain w is able to hydroxylate a wide range of substrates,
including 3-hpa [29]. thus, we propose that the homoprotoca-
techuate pathway is an additional convergent route involved in 3-
hpa and 4-hpa degradation in b. xenovorans lb400.

proteomic analyses of lb400 cells grown on 3-hpa and 4-hpa
provided additional evidence that
the homogentisate central
pathway is involved in the catabolism of 3-hpa and 4-hpa.
the induction of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase hmgb by 3-hpa
and 4-hpa was observed. the hmgb protein was induced in 3-
hpa-grown cells (3.5-fold) and in 4-hpa-grown cells (2.5-fold)

hydroxyphenylacetates catabolism by b. xenovorans

figure 7. model of 3-hpa and 4-hpa catabolic pathways in b. xenovorans lb400. proposed main routes for hydroxyphenylacetates
oxidation in lb400 are indicated with thick arrows, whereas the not preferentially oxidation route is indicated with a thin arrow. a,
hydroxyphenylacetates catabolism via ortho-cleavage pathway (continuous line). the substrates and products are: 3-hpa (3-hydroxyphenylacetate);
4-hpa (4-hydroxyphenylacetate); hmg (homogentisate); ma (maleylacetoacetate) and fa (fumarylacetoacetate). the enzymes are mhaab (3-hpa 6-
hydroxylase); hmga (hmg 1,2-dioxygenase); hmgc (maleylacetate isomerase), hmgb (fumarylacetate hydrolase). b, hydroxyphenylacetates
catabolism via meta-cleavage pathway (dotted line). the metabolites are: hpc (homoprotocatechuate), chms (5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxy-muconic
semialdehyde), chm (5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxy-muconic acid), opet (5-oxo-pent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylic acid), hhdd (2-hydroxy-hept-2,4-diene-
1,7-dioic acid), ohed (2-oxo-hept-3-ene-1,7-dioic acid), and hhed (2,4-dihydroxy-hept-2-ene-1,7-dioic acid). the enzymes are hpabc (4-hpa
monooxygenase), hpad (hpc 2,3-dioxygenase), hpae (chms dehydrogenase), hpaf (chm isomerase), hpag (opet decarboxylase), hpah (ohed
hydratase), hpai (hhed aldolase), and sad (succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase). we propose that in strain lb400 3-hpa is preferentially channeled
into the homogentisate central pathway, whereas 4-hpa is channeled actively in both homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate central pathways.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017583.g007

compared to glucose-grown cells. as suggested above, 3-hpa
hydroxylation mediated by the mhaab gene products from strain
lb400 is in accordance with 3-hpa catabolism via hmg revealed
by proteomic analyses. 4-hpa degradation also has been reported
to funnel into the homogentisate route, by hydroxylation at carbon
1 in pseudomonas acidovorans and azoarcus evansii [40,41]. therefore, it
is likely that 4-hpa is metabolized through the homogentisate
pathway in lb400, in accordance with hmgb2 induction during 4-
hpa metabolism observed by 2d-page. the hmgb2 gene is
adjacent to the hmga2 gene (bxea3900) in c1 of strain lb400. this
is in accordance with hmga2 expression observed during growth in
3-hpa and 4-hpa. the induction of hmgb protein suggests an up-
regulation of the homogentisate pathway during 3-hpa and 4-hpa
degradation in strain lb400. moreover, hmg dioxygenase activity
measured in crude extracts of strain lb400 suggested also induction
of hmg catabolic genes. the hmgr regulator protein from p. putida
strain u is an iclr-type regulator divergently transcribed from

hmgabc cluster and acts as a repressor of hmg genes [19]. however, a
gene similar to the hmgr protein from p. putida u was not identified
in the hmga1b1c1 cluster neighborhood and other regions of the
genome of strain lb400. the transcription analyses suggested that
expression of the homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate path-
ways are controlled at transcriptional level in lb400, in which the
presence of specific substrates such as 3-hpa and 4-hpa are
required. a gene encoding a hpar regulator is located adjacent to
the hpagedfhi gene cluster in lb400 genome. it has been
determined that the hpar protein of e. coli strain c regulates
transcription of the hpagedfhi cluster and it is induced by 4-hpa
or hpc [26]. it
is likely that 4-hpa, 3-hpa or metabolic
intermediates such as hpc may regulate expression of hpa cluster
in lb400 mediated by hpar (fig. 1b).

genome characterization of b. xenovorans lb400 revealed in-
teresting catabolic capabilities. in this work, we provided evidence on
the functionality of the two chromosomally encoded homogentisate

and homoprotocatechuate central pathways. in addition,
it was
shown that the 3-hpa and 4-hpa catabolic peripheral pathways are
active. moreover, two functional hmga genes were used by lb400
during 3-hpa catabolism. based on growth and degradation assays,
gene expression analyses, protein synthesis and key dioxygenases
activities, we postulate that in strain lb400 3-hpa and 4-hpa
separately funnel into both homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate
central pathways. probably, 3-hpa is preferentially channelled into
the homogentisate central pathway, whereas 4-hpa is channelled
actively in both central pathways. this study reveals the wide
aromatic catabolic repertoire of strain lb400, linking the abilities
predicted in silico with those observed at functional level. further-
more, the utilization of both ortho- and meta-cleavage pathways in the
